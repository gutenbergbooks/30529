<h2>PUBLISHER'S NOTE</h2>

<p>The material in this volume was gathered by the
Division of Rural Developments of Studies in
Methods of Americanization.</p>

<p>Americanization in this study has been considered
as the union of native and foreign born
in all the most fundamental relationships and
activities of our national life. For Americanization
is the uniting of new with native-born
Americans in fuller common understanding and
appreciation to secure by means of self-government
the highest welfare of all. Such Americanization
should perpetuate no unchangeable political,
domestic, and economic regime delivered
once for all to the fathers, but a growing and
broadening national life, inclusive of the best
wherever found. With all our rich heritages,
Americanism will develop best through a mutual
giving and taking of contributions from both
newer and older Americans in the interest of the
commonweal. This study has followed such an
understanding of Americanization.</p>

<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>This volume is the result of studies in methods
of Americanization prepared through funds furnished
by the Carnegie Corporation of New York.
It arose out of the fact that constant applications
were being made to the Corporation for contributions
to the work of numerous agencies engaged
in various forms of social activity intended to
extend among the people of the United States
the knowledge of their government and their
obligations to it. The trustees felt that a study
which should set forth, not theories of social
betterment, but a description of the methods of
the various agencies engaged in such work, would
be of distinct value to the cause itself and to the
public.</p>

<p>The outcome of the study is contained in eleven
volumes on the following subjects: Schooling of
the Immigrant; The Press; Adjustment of
Homes and Family Life; Legal Protection and
Correction; Health Standards and Care; Naturalization
and Political Life; Industrial and Economic
Amalgamation; Treatment of Immigrant
Heritages; Neighborhood Agencies and Organization;
Rural Developments; and Summary.
The entire study has been carried out under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
general direction of Mr. Allen T. Burns. Each
volume appears in the name of the author who
had immediate charge of the particular field it
is intended to cover.</p>

<p>Upon the invitation of the Carnegie Corporation
a committee consisting of the late Theodore
Roosevelt, Prof. John Graham Brooks, Dr. John
M. Glenn, and Mr. John A. Voll has acted in
an advisory capacity to the director. An editorial
committee consisting of Dr. Talcott Williams,
Dr. Raymond B. Fosdick, and Dr. Edwin
F. Gay has read and criticized the manuscripts.
To both of these committees the trustees of the
Carnegie Corporation are much indebted.</p>

<p>The purpose of the report is to give as clear
a notion as possible of the methods of the agencies
actually at work in this field and not to
propose theories for dealing with the complicated
questions involved.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Students of economics know that the roundabout
methods of capitalistic production are far
more fruitful than the direct methods of the
primitive economy. As we advance, we introduce
new intermediaries between the beginning and
the end of production. This thought occurs to
one in the study of Americanization. If we would
Americanize the immigrant we must seek him
out in his daily economic life and see to it that
the influences under which he works are calculated
to give him the right feeling toward his
new home. A large part of our waking life is
spent in gaining a livelihood, and our work brings
with it most of our associations. School and
church have their place for young and old, and
they likewise must be considered. Their effect
is direct and immediate and is more likely to
attract attention than are the elements making
up the economic life.</p>

<p>Doctor Speek has done well in taking up the
immigrant as a settler in the newer and developing
parts of our country. The settlers are very
largely immigrants who are trying to acquire a
home and livelihood on the land. The writer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
this Introduction has been studying this same
subject for many years, and has done so in many
different parts of the United States. The conclusion
which we might reach deductively is confirmed
by observation&mdash;namely, that the man who
settles on the land in the right way is, with the
rarest exceptions, likely to become a good American,
as are also his children.</p>

<p>But what do we mean by the right way? We
mean that he must be on a farm of suitable size,
of good productivity, with needed help in learning
how to farm in the new country and with
sufficient time in which to pay for his farm.
These are not the only considerations, but they
are the main ones, and to these Doctor Speek has
given his attention.</p>

<p>One of the outstanding features of every study
of land settlement is that the first great cause of
failure is poor selection of land. The second
chief cause of failure is insufficient length of time
in which to pay for the land. While this is of
very great importance, it stands far behind the
first as a cause of failure. The third cause of
failure is closely connected with the second. It
is inadequate credit and capital.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with the results which are
universal. The selection of land is extremely
difficult, even for unusually intelligent farmers
who have had long experience in our country.
To select land wisely is quite beyond the capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
of the ordinary settler. The present writer could
give unlimited illustrations of this truth. The
man who has lived in the corn belt of Illinois is
very apt to think that black soil is necessarily
good soil, and, going to another state, may perhaps
select some black peat land, underlain with
sand, which is almost worthless. He is sure to be
prejudiced against red soil, which may, after all,
be good land. Once, when the writer was being
shown citrous-fruit land in California, the wise
friend who was his host would point to one
orchard, which was "planted for oranges," and
another "ranch" which "was planted to sell to
suckers"; yet the ordinary man, even if he spent
many years in the study of land values, could not
tell the difference.</p>

<p>John Stuart Mill presents, in his <i>Principles of
Political Economy</i>, strong arguments for non-intervention
of public authority in "the business
of the community." He says that those who
stand for intervention must make out a strong
case. When, however, he turns to the consumer
or buyer, he finds he is obliged to make many
exceptions to the rule of non-intervention. To
use his own words,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
"The proposition that the
consumer is a competent judge of the commodity
can be admitted only with numerous abatements
and exceptions." He uses also these words:
<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
                              "Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
the buyer always qualified to judge of the commodity?
If not, the presumption in favor of the
competition of the market does not apply to the
case; and if the commodity be one in the quality
of which society has much at stake, the balance
of advantages may be in favor of some mode and
degree of intervention by the authorized representatives
of the collective interest of the state."</p>

<p>We have, then, ample justification for some
kind of help to the settler in the selection of land.
What Doctor Speek presents to us simply confirms
what is known to every thoughtful person
who has given attention to the subject of land
settlement. If we want to bring it about that
our settlers should understand our institutions
and become good American citizens, we must
abandon all ideas of <i>laissez-faire</i> with respect to
land selection. Generally the selection is made
for the settler by the land agent. Doctor Speek
gives attention to the real-estate business, and
finds that it is not in a satisfactory condition.
About this there can be no question. At the
same time the present writer, as a result of careful
observation, affirms without hesitation that
probably no business has made greater progress
toward a true professional level than has the land
business during the last five years. Real-estate
agents or brokers are forming associations and are
doing a great deal to eliminate dishonest practices
and to put into their business the idea of service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
There are two lines of progress especially noteworthy.
One is the development of Blue Sky
laws, and the other is the requirement that those
who engage in the real-estate business should
have licenses. Blue Sky laws do not as yet
afford anything like adequate protection, but
certainly they may not be disregarded with impunity
in Wisconsin. Licensing an occupation
has been very generally one of the first steps
toward putting it upon a professional basis.
Doctor Speek relates what was attempted unsuccessfully
in California. In Wisconsin we are
just beginning the system of licenses, and so far
it promises to be extremely helpful. Much more
needs to be done, however, to help the settler
make a good selection of a farm.</p>

<p>Two outstanding movements are mentioned.
One is the public-land settlement of California,
under the direction of Dr. Elwood Mead, and the
other is the work of the Director of Immigration
of Wisconsin, Mr. B. G. Packer. Mr. Packer
has been in the habit of meeting settlers in
Chicago, the chief doorway into Wisconsin, and
giving them advice of a general character in
regard to the purchase of a farm in Wisconsin.
While he is not in a position to recommend the
purchase of a specific piece of land, the advice is
pretty concrete and definite. His one thought
very properly is the welfare of the settler, and
he believes that it is in the interest of Wisconsin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
not to get as many settlers as possible, but to
get settlers who, in his own words, "stick"&mdash;in
other words, who will succeed. He does not for
a moment hesitate to discourage a man from
coming to Wisconsin if he is not likely to prove
successful, and he does not for a moment hesitate
to direct the attention of a settler away from a
selection which would prove disastrous to him.
The writer has visited many settlers in Wisconsin
who have been brought to the state by Mr.
Packer, and has found them almost universally
prosperous.</p>

<p>However, attention should be directed particularly
to an important point made by Doctor
Speek in his report. At present irresponsible and
dishonest people often get hold of the settler
first. Mr. Packer's work is being rapidly developed
and it should have still larger funds for
expansion. How is it going to be possible, however,
to bring to the knowledge of all the settlers
the helpful agencies that exist? These helpful
agencies include not only the work of Mr.
Packer, but of the county agents, and the different
departments of the agricultural college,
especially that department concerned with soil
surveys, as well as with many others.</p>

<p>In other states as well there are many helpful
agencies for the settler. If the settler could
only get hold of the men who are glad to help him he
could make a wise selection of the land. Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
and state authorities must co-operate in efforts
to bring to the settler a knowledge of the help
that may be his.</p>

<p>The City and Suburban Homes Company, of
New York City, affords a suggestion. This company
was formed in order to give the best homes
possible to people in and about New York City
compatible with very modest return on capital.
The idea is that of serving the urban dweller.
Vast as is the field of operation, it has accomplished
appreciable results in New York City.
Could not companies be formed to begin where
the City and Suburban Homes Company leaves
off? Two possibilities suggest themselves. One
is the purchase and sale of land, and the other is
disinterested advice.</p>

<p>In this imperfect world perfection can never
be attained, and with the best efforts mistakes
will be made. With a strange perversity men
often turn from those who are their true friends
and give their confidence to the unscrupulous.
A typical case is this: A man sold his small farm
at a fair price. Those to whom he sold it were
apprehensive lest he should waste the money
and tried to help him make a wise investment.
He had every reason for confidence in those who
were trying to help him and who had never
misled him, yet he was evidently suspicious that
they were trying to serve their own ends.
Shortly after receiving the money he took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
journey into Canada, fell into the hands of land
sharks, and lost every dollar he had received in
the purchase of worthless lands.</p>

<p>As a business becomes professional in character,
connections are established with educational
institutions. Medicine and law both occur to one
as illustrations. Our universities are now developing
courses in land economics, and these
are going to be helpful in solving the problems
of land settlement, as well as other land problems.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the length of time
needed to pay for a farm. No mistake is more
frequent than the mistake made in underestimating
the length of time needed to buy a farm
and to pay for it under the amortization plan&mdash;that
is to say, by yearly installments, which
include, with interest, a portion of the capital.
Ireland affords a good illustration. As one great
Land Act has followed another, the length of time
for the payment of the farm has been increased,
until now the amortization period is about sixty-eight
years.</p>

<p>With the higher return to labor in this country
the writer thinks twenty-five to thirty years is
about right. When we have this period for payment
the annual payments of principal are small
and the farmer has the sense of ownership and is
able to bring up his family, giving the children
a good education, and enjoying life as he goes
on. All plans for land settlement should include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
long credit payments for land purchase; also
provision of shorter periods for purchase of equipment.
We are making progress in the provision
of rural credit, but we still have a long way to go.</p>

<p>A plan that should be emphasized is that we
need the help of the many private agencies that
have been developed. While splendid experiments
are being conducted in California, so far
the land settlement of that state cannot be regarded
as anything more than experimental.
The first purchase consisted of ten thousand
acres. On the other hand, a single company in
one part of the country visited by Doctor Speek
is making a fine settlement of sixty thousand
acres. Land settlement is extremely complex
and thousands of honest men have developed
skill and knowledge in the solution of its problems.
We need their services and we must use
every effort to protect them, as well as the settler,
against dishonest and incompetent individuals,
agents and companies.</p>

<p>The district attorney's office of New York
City has achieved noteworthy success in ferreting
out land frauds and affording certain protection
to land buyers. Our criminal laws need
further development. In every state there should
be those to whom the settler can turn with his
grievance. This is required for the protection of
the honest land company, as well as for the protection
of the settler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
When the Wisconsin Railroad Commission was
established, the idea was that one should be able
to write on a post card his complaint against
any railroad company, and that the commission
should take up and investigate the case. As
Doctor Speek says, we need Federal and state
commissions. These should prosecute relentlessly
cases of fraud, and at the same time encourage
right practices.</p>

<p>We hear much about unused land which ought
to be brought into use. Investigations made by
Mr. O. E. Baker, of the Office of Farm Management,
U. S. Department of Agriculture, and
others, show that the idea that there are vast
stretches of really good land which are not being
utilized is fallacious. It stands to reason it
should be so. If I have land that is worth a
dollar an acre per annum I am not likely to allow
it to be unused. I have to pay taxes on the land,
and I have the interest charge, which is still more
important. We do have, however, a great and
crying evil in the mistaken, as well as the dishonest,
attempt to bring into use land which is
not susceptible of profitable use by settlers, or
by any private individuals, for that matter.</p>

<p>Probably somewhat less than half of the land
of the United States can at present be profitably
cultivated, and a large proportion of it has no
value for the individual. Nevertheless, a large
proportion of this inferior land is privately owned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
and the owner is under a constant temptation to
sell it to the settler. One of the chief problems
we have is to take out of the market this submarginal
land, which is responsible for so many
ruined and embittered lives. Dishonest sale of
poor land to unsuspecting settlers is a cause of
Bolshevism, which we ought to fight in every
possible way.</p>

<p>Another point made by Doctor Speek relates
to access to the land. How much utter nonsense
has been talked about access to the land. As
Doctor Speek points out, access to the land means
a great many different things. If it is to amount
to anything, it means knowledge based upon
experience and it means capital. There is no
magic about access to the land any more than
there is about access to any other occupation
than farming. A man who goes into any occupation,
if he is going to be successful, must have
the requisite tools, the requisite experience, and
the requisite capital.</p>

<p>The writer would like to touch upon many
other points suggested by Doctor Speek's excellent
report. One only, however, will be mentioned.
We have spoken about the selection of
land. We must also remember that those who
are settling the land are those who are going to
make up our rural population. Every state in
the Union, as well as the Federal government,
should consider the qualifications of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
are settling the land. We are going to have the
experience of every European country. That is,
by no possibility can everyone who would like to
own a farm have one, any more than can
everyone who would like to own some other
business obtain it. No better illustration could
be taken than that of Ireland, when visited by
the writer in 1913. There was not land enough
to afford farms to all those who wanted farms.
A selection had to be made. As we should have
agencies to help select land, we should also make
a wise selection of those who are to become our
land owners and cultivators in our rural communities.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>

<p>This report summarizes the results of a preliminary
survey of rural developments in the
United States from the viewpoint of the Americanization
of immigrant settlers conducted by
the writer for the Study of Methods of Americanization.</p>

<p>The field study covered a period of about four
months, from June to September, 1918, inclusive,
during which time the writer with his wife,
Frances Valiant Speek, as his assistant, visited
fifty-four cities and rural immigrant colonies in
New England, the North Middle Western, the
Western, and the Southwestern states. The
cities and colonies visited and the nationalities
involved are given in the order followed in the
field study:</p>

<p>In addition to observation of the conditions
in the colonies, numbers of the immigrant settlers,
their leaders, native neighbors, and local public
officials were interviewed on the subject of the
survey. This was later supplemented by research,
conducted mainly by the writer's assistant
in the Library of Congress. No attempt was
made to collect facts and material in a quantitative
sense, attention being concentrated on what
seemed to be outstanding facts, conditions, and
cases.</p>

<p>In the writing of this summary the writer, as
an immigrant himself, has also used his own experiences
and earlier observations beginning in
1909, and his observations during his field investigation
of the conditions of floating laborers in
this country for the United States Commission
on Industrial Relations during 1913&ndash;15.</p>

<p>The fundamental conclusion at which the
writer has arrived in this summary is as follows:</p>

<p>The establishment of a home may involve
direct material assistance, but requires protection,
direction, and instruction given to the
home-seeking and home-building immigrants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
These aspects of the problem are discussed in
Part I.</p>

<p>In the question of education the instruction of
adult immigrants as well as immigrant children
is important. Among all educational agencies
the public school is the foremost. The parochial
school and Catholic and Lutheran churches are,
in many of the districts studied. Part II discusses
the relative efficacy of public and private
educational agencies in tying the immigrant into
American life and loyalties.</p>

<h1>A STAKE IN THE LAND</h1>

<h2>I<br />
NEED OF A LAND POLICY</h2>

<p>One of the strongest ties uniting human beings
is found among the members of a family, the
unit which is the foundation of the structure of
organized society. Each family requires a home
for its normal life and development. A normal
home, especially in rural districts, means a piece
of land and a suitable house for the family;
it implies also an opportunity to earn the family
living either on the same land&mdash;if it is large
enough, as in the case of truck gardens or farms&mdash;or
in a near-by industrial establishment; it implies
acquaintances and friends in the same neighborhood,
and certain minimum necessities of modern
civilized life, such as roads, post office, newspaper,
church, school, physician.</p>

<h3>STRENGTH OF HOME TIES</h3>

<p>When an immigrant has succeeded in establishing
such a home in America he invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
answers, when questioned as to whether he considers
America or the land of his birth to be his
country, that America is his country. And he
goes on to explain, saying that America is a
free country, with better chances for everybody;
that he has made his home here; that his children
have been born here; that they have better
schooling and much brighter hope for the future.
For all these reasons, he explains, he does not
want to return to his native country except
perhaps on a visit, and he repeats again and
again that America, not his old country, is now
his homeland.</p>

<p>There is no other tie that binds a man so
closely to a country as his home. No wonder,
for home is everybody's center of the world,
lookout tower, refuge, and resting place. With
it are associated the most intimate and tender
feelings a human being ever experiences, and
naturally the same fine feelings extend to the
place in which one's home is located. So we
speak of fatherland, motherland, homeland, expressing
in these words the close intimacy between
family, home, country, and ourselves.</p>

    <p class="caption">LAND IS NOT THE ONLY STAKE IN AMERICA FOR THESE POLISH PARENTS<br /></p>
</div>

<p>In direct distinction, the word "homeless"
has implications of aimless drifting, of destitution
and misery, and of the indifference of a "homeless"
man to "his" country. Certain advocates
of cosmopolitanism in their agitation against
patriotism often take advantage of the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of home in the relation of a man to his
country when they appeal to the "proletarians":
"Do you own anything? Do you have even a
home in this country? If not, why then should
you love it?"</p>

<p>Although a home means a little world by itself&mdash;much
more than a piece of land with a shelter
on it&mdash;the establishment of a home, nevertheless,
involves, first of all, the acquisition of a piece of
land, even though it be the smallest suburban
building lot with a twenty-five-foot frontage. If
the piece of land is large enough so that its owner,
if he is inclined to land cultivation, can make a
living by working on it as either gardener or
farmer, so much the better.</p>

<h3>IMMIGRANTS' LOVE OF THE LAND</h3>

<p>It so happens that a large number of immigrants
who come to our shores with the intention of
remaining here desire to establish a home, to
acquire land, and to become land cultivators in
America. Most of them have had farming
experience in Europe. But what actually has
happened and is happening year after year is
that these immigrants, saturated with farm life
and experience, drift to the cities, to work in
mines and factories and at pick-and-shovel jobs.</p>

<p>This fact was confirmed so clearly by the
investigation of the United States Immigration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Commission that its report has been the basis of
the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From one third to three fifths of these newcomers, the
proportion varying according to race, had been engaged in
agricultural pursuits before coming to the United States, but
not one in ten has settled on farms in this country.
<a name="FNanchor_B_1" id="FNanchor_B_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_1" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></div>

<p>In the year 1900, as is shown in Table I, there
were 276,745 foreign-born white persons of both
sexes employed as farm laborers in this country.
In 1910 the number of immigrant agricultural
laborers was 336,753, an increase of 60,008, or
about 22 per cent.<br /><br /></p>

According to the reports of the Commissioner
General of Immigration, 1,602,748 immigrant
agricultural laborers, male and female, arrived
in the United States between 1901 and 1910,
both years inclusive. If all of these incoming
agricultural laborers had found employment on
farms in this country, the increase of immigrant
agricultural laborers in 1910 over the number of
1900 would have been 579 per cent instead of
22 per cent.</p>

<p>The United States Immigration Commission
made a detailed study of 17,141 households, the
heads of which were miners or wage earners in
manufacturing establishments. Of the persons
of these households for whom complete data
were secured, 62 per cent of the males and 24
per cent of the females were employed as farm
laborers or as farmers before coming to the
United States. The Immigration Commission
also secured detailed information from 181,330
male and 12,968 female employees in mines and
manufacturing establishments. Of these, 54 per
cent of the males and 44 per cent of the females
were employed in the old country in farming or
as farm laborers.<a name="FNanchor_B_3" id="FNanchor_B_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_3" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The transformation of European peasants into
mill hands and miners in America is to be
ascribed partially to the fact that land was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
available to them when they arrived in this
country. Either they did not know where the
land which awaited a cultivator was located, or
they had not enough money to buy such land,
or they lacked credit needed to undertake operations
in clearing and preparing new land, or they
were ignorant of American farming conditions.
Some seemingly insurmountable reason prevented
them from following their desires and calling.</p>

<p>This occupational change has resulted in loss
to this country. The experience in agriculture
of these large numbers of men, coupled with
their ability for the hard manual labor required
in truck gardening, in intensive farming, and
especially in the opening up of new land, has
been wastefully cast aside. The significance of
such loss is clear in view of the fundamental
importance of agriculture in the nation's life.
About two thirds of the area of our country is
uncultivated as yet, and the one third that is
cultivated is worked extensively rather than
intensively. Furthermore, native Americans and
even old-time immigrants avoid hard pioneering
work in the wilderness since they can find opportunities
of lighter work and better returns elsewhere,
on already established and "paying"
farms.</p>

<p>Aside from economic loss there has also been a
loss in social values. The desire of a large number
of immigrants to establish permanent rural homes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and to become citizens here has gone to the winds.
Instead of scattering over the country and mingling
with the native population, they have been
driven to the congested cities and have formed
there Little Polands, Little Italies, ghettos,
etc., remaining almost untouched by American
influences. Both the economic and the social
loss might have been averted to a considerable
degree if the nation had had an effective land
policy and if it had come to the aid of the immigrants
in distributing and settling them on the
land.</p>

<p>The certainty in the mind of an immigrant
that there is a stake in the land for him, and his
confidence that in the acquirement of his stake
he gets a square deal from all concerned, are
more important from the viewpoint of Americanization
than the actual acquirement of any
settlement on land; for not all immigrants desire
to own a piece of land and work on it, and not
all who desire to can actually do so. Other considerations&mdash;for
instance, family conditions, industrial
opportunities, city attractions, etc.&mdash;prevent
a number of such immigrants from becoming
farmers. Many come to America only to make
money so as to return and buy land at home. For
land ownership is to them the goal in life. What
a change in this transient attitude might be made
by a policy of having land available and usable
for such birds of passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Certainty and confidence as purely psychological
factors in the process of Americanization
can be cultivated in the immigrants by affording
effective public guidance and protection to those
who actually attempt to settle on land.</p>

<p>As the land settlement conditions now are, a
large number of the land-seeking immigrants are
disappointed in the acquirement of land; they
have no confidence in the land sellers and dealers,
and they have even become suspicious of the
country's laws and public institutions connected
with land transfer by purchase. To illustrate:
An old-time Italian immigrant, a skilled truck
gardener, working for another Italian near a
small Eastern town, explained to the writer:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have saved a small sum of money for the purpose of
buying a piece of land. But after years of search I have not
succeeded in acquiring a piece of land suitable for gardening.
All land seems to have been already "grabbed." The price
asked is so high that one hardly is able to work it out of the
soil. Last year a "Yankee" sold me some land, but he did
not give it to me; he wanted only my money. I had to take
a lawyer, but he did not get the land that I had bought for
me. Only my money was returned, half of which the lawyer
kept for himself as a fee for his services. There is no help
from lawyers or courts. I lost my savings of years. The
land-selling business in this country is a big humbug. Too
bad!</p></div>

<h3>NEED FOR LAND REGULATION</h3>

<p>It is an astonishing, almost unbelievable fact
that, although nearly all industrial and trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
pursuits have come under some sort of public
regulation, licensing, or supervision&mdash;even such
minor trades as shoeblacking, fruit peddling,
and mere popcorn and peanut selling&mdash;land
dealing, one of the most basic of all trades, has
been practically overlooked by our lawmakers.</p>

<p>The regulation of a trade requires a definite
policy toward the present and future of the trade
in relation to the public safety and welfare, and
especially is this true in regard to the regulation
of land dealing. The United States needs acutely
regulation of land dealing within its boundaries,
and as a natural antecedent to regulation it
should have and must have a definite land
policy. To go one step farther, no efficient policy
is possible unless it is founded on certain sound
principles. What are the guiding principles for
a practical land policy?</p>

<p>First of all, there is the economic principle.
It is the increase of food production, on which
the very life of the nation, its development
and future strength, depend. The war demonstrated
this in a most convincing way. The
increase of productivity of the land must be
continuous and permanent. The 1920 Census
reports city population increases five times as
rapidly as rural. Aside from conservation of
the soil&mdash;that is, saving what we have&mdash;there
must go on constant improvement of the soil
by fertilizing and by the introduction of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
efficient methods of cultivation, intensive as well
as extensive.</p>

<p>Then comes the social principle of an efficient
land policy, with the end in view of affording
more opportunities for the establishment of
family homes. Among other results, this would
closely bind the foreign-born elements of the
population to the country and in this way materially
assist the assimilation process. It would
make for better public health and for greater
happiness of the people.</p>

<p>The political goal is the stability of democracy
and the strength of the country in domestic and
international relations, in peace and in war.
The agrarian disorders of Europe, its varied turmoils,
revolutions, and war, accompanied by
starvation and epidemics, are to a large degree
due to the old prevailing out-of-date forms of
land tenure inherited from mediæval times.</p>

<p>Toward these ends certain changes and reforms
in the distribution and colonization of land
should be undertaken. The existing conditions
are such as require prompt attention, not only
in the interests of the general public and for
the sake of the general good of the country, but
especially for the sake of the immigrant. Because
of his greater ignorance and helplessness and his
usually strong desire to settle on land, he suffers
more often and more severely than the native-born
American from the unscrupulousness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
dishonesty and <i>laissez-faire</i> methods that flourish
in the absence of a public land policy and public
land regulation.</p>

<p>The partial or utter misfortune which the immigrant
so often experiences molds his entire
opinion of and attitude toward the United States.
From the viewpoint of the Americanization of
the immigrant, therefore, the questions of land
policy, land colonization, and land dealing are
of the utmost importance. Before a discussion of
reforms is begun, a general description of present
conditions, from this point of view of Americanization,
is necessary.</p>

<hr class="line" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<h2>II<br />
LEARNING OF LAND OPPORTUNITIES</h2>

<p>The immigrant desiring to settle on land is constantly
on the lookout for an opportunity to
acquire land. The most general way of learning
of such opportunity is through personal acquaintance
or through correspondence with relatives
and friends of the immigrant's own nationality
who have previously settled on land. These
sources of information are considered by the
immigrant to be the most reliable, although they
have certain drawbacks.</p>

<h3>FRIENDS, AGENTS, AND ADVERTISEMENTS</h3>

<p>First, immigrants on the land are always desirous
of increasing the number of people of their own
race or nationality in their particular locality, for
the sake of their own advantage; for the larger
their community the better their social and
business opportunities. Therefore they are often
prone to exaggerate the advantages of land and
farming in their section and to be silent as to the
disadvantages, so as to induce more people of
their race to join the community.</p>

    <p class="caption">THE OWNER OF THIS FARM, SETTLED IN 1917, HAS PERSUADED<br />
                       SIX MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY TO BUY FARMS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Second, it is quite a common practice among
immigrant settlers to receive from land companies
certain commissions for bringing in further
settlers, which induce them to exaggerate the
good qualities of the land. The usual commission
in the North Middle states is fifty cents per
acre. The prospective buyers of land do not
usually know about this.</p>

<p>There are also cases where a settler has secretly
become a regular agent of the land company,
receiving from the latter a salary in addition to
a commission on each piece of land sold through
him. In such cases the agent, known to the
prospective buyer only as an ordinary settler, is
in a position to get much higher prices for the
land than a regular agent.</p>

<p>Still more danger for the immigrant lurks in
the scheme whereby immigrant settlers already
on the land, or their native-born neighbors,
seeing that new people are coming in rapidly,
take options on valuable land in certain desirable
localities and resell it to the newcomers at a
much higher price. Near Willington, Connecticut,
there is a Bohemian colony, and in the days
when this colony was growing rapidly a Bohemian
settler looked up land available there
and took a number of options on farms for which
he already had would-be buyers. He took an
option on one farm for its purchase at the price
of $500; to the buyer he charged $1,500, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
made a clear profit of $1,000. According to a
report of the Immigration Commission relating
to the same colony, a man who paid $1,000 in
cash for a farm found that the land "agent"
who sold it to him had bought the option from
the original owner for $400 a few weeks before
the bargain was closed.</p>

<p>Quite a number of land companies are employing
immigrant agents, especially of those nationalities
and races with which they expect to do
business on a large scale. Usually these agents
are sent out to the immigrant centers in industrial
towns. They bring the prospective immigrant
settlers to see the land and they conduct the
business in cases where the immigrants do not
know English. The companies consider this the
most effective way of reaching immigrants who
desire to settle on land.</p>

<p>Another way in which immigrants learn of
land opportunities is through the land companies'
advertisements in the foreign-language
newspapers. The immigrant newspapers, depending
on a nation-wide constituency, are, as a
rule, careful in accepting trade advertisements.
Often the editor, before accepting the advertisement
from the land company, makes a personal
visit to the company's main office to find out
whether the advertisement is honest or put out
by schemers and crooks. According to the testimony
of the land companies the editors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
foreign-language newspapers, in the vast majority
of cases, are honest men who refuse to be
bribed. Only in a very few cases have the
editors agreed to accept commissions.</p>

<p>Finally comes the usual method of all land
companies, that of sending out agents among the
immigrants, sending them folders, etc. As a
rule the advertisements and folders exaggerate
the good points of the land and gloss over the
bad points. Quite often the exaggerations know
no bounds; the land is described as the most
fertile on the surface of the earth&mdash;photographs
show corn, for instance, growing like a forest; a
record of the yield is given, showing it to bring
hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year
per acre. Such exaggerations may be illustrated
by the literature sent out by the New South
Farm and Home Company, advertising ten-acre
farms in Florida. The representations were that
the farms were not swampy, were near direct
water connections with New York; that every
month in the year was a growing month; that
the farms were surrounded by orange and citrous-fruit
farms; that there were fine roads, wells,
homes, schools, hotels, etc.; that the titles were
perfect; that neighboring farms were doubling,
trebling, and quadrupling in price; that the
settlements were rapidly growing; that there
was every convenience and comfort, such as
Pullman cars, long-distance telephone, etc., etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
It is needless to say that many of these advantages
were nonexistent. The decision of the Supreme
Court of the United States in regard to
this case was that when a proposed seller goes
beyond mere exaggeration of the qualities of an
article and assigns to it qualities which it does
not possess, "does not simply magnify in opinion
the advantages which it has, but invents advantages
and falsely asserts their existence, he
transcends the limit of 'puffing' and engages in
false representations and pretenses." By this
decision it was established that to invent advantages
and falsely assert their existence in a
transaction of sale is a fraud.</p>

<h3>FEDERAL AND STATE IMMIGRATION OFFICES</h3>

<p>The information given to immigrants by the
Federal and state immigration offices is of value,
because it presents certain facts needed by
settlers, as, for instance, information on climatic
conditions, general soil and market conditions,
and so on. But these information bulletins often
do not reach the immigrants because the immigrants
do not know enough to ask for them; and,
even supposing that they did reach the prospective
settler, the bulletins are too general. They
describe the conditions of large districts and sections
of the country or state, while what the
immigrant needs is exact, detailed knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
about a particular piece of land in which he is
interested. The government officials claim that
they have not sufficient forces to undertake a
detailed investigation of individual land holdings,
and also that they must try to avoid any appearance
of discriminating between various land
companies in the sense of encouraging or discouraging
the sale of land belonging to given
companies.</p>

<p>In general, one might say that the ways open
to immigrants for learning of land opportunities
are defective. Misrepresentation of land conditions
and actual money frauds have made
them suspicious of any land dealer, so that the
best land companies experience, in the immigrants'
suspicion, a handicap in the development
of their business. This in part explains why the
various real-estate associations are trying to get
some sort of public regulation for their business
and why a number of states which are interested
in the development of their lands have begun to
talk of regulation. They reason that such regulation
would be a good advertisement for the
state and would increase the confidence of people
in the chances of successfully settling on land in
that state.</p>

<h3>POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA AND WISCONSIN</h3>

<p>In the states of California and Wisconsin the
state departments and colleges of agriculture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
through their extension service and the state
immigration offices, are doing highly valuable
work in disseminating correct information in
regard to land opportunities among prospective
settlers and in defending the latter against
unscrupulous land dealers. The writer was
especially impressed by the methods used by the
Director of Immigration of the Wisconsin Department
of Agriculture, Mr. B. G. Packer. The
following statement dictated by Mr. Packer
serves as the best description of his work and
methods:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Four years ago, at the invitation of the Department of
Labor, in Chicago, I began going down and meeting people
by appointment there&mdash;immigrants who wanted to come to
Wisconsin. In order to reach them, we advertised in Chicago
papers. We ran classified notices in the metropolitan papers,
in addition inviting correspondence from home seekers. We
ran articles in foreign-language papers, showing what the crops
are and how to open up the land, how to pull up the stumps,
etc. We have had pamphlets on Wisconsin, and methods of
cultivation of its land, published in foreign languages.</p>

<p>I find that the home seekers do not know where to go or
whom to believe, but by meeting them in conferences I have
been able to protect them against exploitation and direct
them to localities where they stand a good show of making
good. The average capital of immigrants will run a little
over fifteen hundred dollars. The average capital of native-born
Americans who come to see me is considerably less.
A man going on the land should have not less than twelve
hundred dollars after making his first payment on forty
acres. We have schedules showing approximately what his
living expenses will be for the first couple of years.</p>

<p>Our work is largely protective. The leading Chicago
papers co-operate with us by refusing the advertising of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
real-estate men who misrepresent their properties. The
state attorney's office co-operates with us by enforcing the
confidence-game statute. Every inquirer is furnished with a
certificate (<a href="#Page_22">see p. 22</a>), and I find that dishonest dealers refuse
to sell to home seekers who present this certificate to them.</p>

<p>One point I should like to emphasize is that the back-to-the-farm
movement will be successful in proportion to each
state's activity in supplying home seekers with information
that will insure their success on the land.</p>

<p>First, those coming into the new land region in our state,
must have enough capital to carry them through the first
two years for the purchase of clothing and food and farm
equipment.</p>

<p>Second, they should have had some experience in farming.
The city-bred man who wishes to get out into the country,
not because of love of the country, but because of dislike of
the city, is a poor investment. Those visiting us who have
not had farm experience are urged to get it before locating
or before investing their money.</p>

<p>Third, the wife must be satisfied and willing to undergo
some pioneering. Right here is where a good many fall down.
The man is willing to go and his wife goes unwillingly.</p>

<p>Fourth, the immigrants should not be flimflammed into
paying excessive prices for undeveloped land. So far as
Wisconsin is concerned, competition takes care of this, provided
the home seeker gets into communication with our
department. To illustrate: One concern in Chicago, operating
in Bayfield County, Wisconsin, is asking forty and
forty-five dollars an acre for cut-over land no better than
may be obtained from lumber and railroad companies for
half this figure.</p>

<p>Fifth, there is a tendency on the part of land salesmen to
load up the immigrant with more land than he can use, or
sometimes pay for. Eighty acres makes a good-sized farm
for one family to develop and handle, and this is the size of
tract recommended.</p>

<p>Sixth, the back-to-the-lander should be a man in good
physical condition. I believe that it is a mistake to put
men on the land who are not heavy enough for farm work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
The man should weigh not less than two pounds for every
inch of his height, which is the army standard.</p>

<p>Seventh, it is a mistake to encourage people to go on the
land after the time for the spring work has passed. I mean
by this that under our conditions the settler has to construct
a small house and do some brushing and clearing in
order to grow vegetables for himself and a small amount of
winter feed for his stock.</p>

<p>Eighth, the back-to-the-lander has too many fake ideas
about the amount of money to be made in farming. Under
our conditions the settler is putting money into his land
and not taking very much out the first two or three years,
unless he has merchantable timber that can be worked up
into cordwood or bolts, or unless he locates in a region having
little timber to be removed, and is able to specialize in
potatoes. The men who have become wealthy from strictly
farming operations are not numerous in Wisconsin or anywhere else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
In a bulletin of information for immigrants,
issued by the Commission of Immigration and
Housing of California, 1920, the commission
offers its assistance to the seekers of land in the
state of California, in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Immigrants who are thinking of buying farm lands should
call upon or write to the office of the Commission of Immigration
and Housing for free information and advice.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) The commission co-operating with the Agricultural
Department of the State University will furnish without
charge general information regarding agricultural lands;
and</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It will make an investigation and free report to any
immigrant concerning any particular tract of land which
he may have visited, and which he contemplates buying.
This report will cover the agricultural possibilities of the
land and its accessibility to markets. If the immigrant
states his previous experience, his financial condition, and
gives other information which may be requested by the
commission, the report will also give advice as to the wisdom
of buying the proposed land.</p></div>

<p>No purchase or contract to purchase land should be made
or entered into until the immigrant knows the nature of the
land, its true money value, and that the land belongs to the
one who proposes to sell it.</p></div>

<p>This is the kind of public assistance which the
land seekers, especially the immigrants, most
urgently need, and to which they are entitled.
The only questions are, will the other states
follow, and how can the opportunity of such reliable
public assistance be made known to the
land-seeking masses?</p>

<h2>III<br />
EXPERIENCES IN ACQUIRING LAND</h2>

<p>The experiences of the Russian sectarian peasants
in America in their attempts to settle on
land are illuminating in regard to existing conditions
of land dealing and colonization as they
affect the immigrant. There are in the Western
states about a thousand families (or six thousand
individuals) of Russian peasant sectarians&mdash;Molokans,
Holy Jumpers, Wet and Dry Baptists,
and others. They were all engaged in
agriculture while they lived in Russia. As a result
of persecution by the Russian monarchy
they left their country and came to America
about ten years ago.</p>

<h3>RUSSIAN SECTARIAN PEASANTS IN THE WEST</h3>

<p>From the beginning of their American adventure
they have had a keen desire to settle on land.
They have made repeated attempts to acquire
farms, but so far failure has been the rule, with
few exceptions.</p>

<p>The facts regarding most of the unsuccessful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
attempts outlined below were obtained at a
meeting of Russian sectarians in Los Angeles
attended by about one hundred family heads.
Each one told his own experience. The men had
great difficulty in indicating American names&mdash;the
names of companies, counties, etc.&mdash;so that
in the following account names are omitted.
When questioned as to how they could secure so
much money, they explained that they all work
whenever it is possible to find work, that they
live moderately, that their men and women
dress cheaply, that they do not drink or smoke or
go to any places of amusement, as all that is prohibited
by their religion, and that they save.
They stated that their land-seeking attempts are
backed financially by the entire colony; the
losses are shared by all its members, although
the individual families who are on the firing line
lose more than the families who remain in Los
Angeles and back these scouting parties.</p>

<p>These peasants believe that their difficulty in
finding and settling on land has been due to
several causes. First, they have not enough
money to buy immediately a large tract of land,
irrigate and improve it, and give the families a
good start. Second, they do not know the
country and conditions well enough, especially
the agricultural possibilities. Third, the private
land dealers are mostly crooks who cheat them,
either by misrepresenting the quality of the land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
or by not fulfilling their contract promises, or by
making contracts so complicated and so filled
with catches that they afterward prove the ruin
of the settler. The following are some of the
most important of the attempts to find land.</p>

<p>From thirty to thirty-three families made a
land-purchase contract with a company of &mdash;&mdash; County,
Washington. One hundred and sixty
acres were sold to each family, at a price of from
$40 to $50 an acre. Each family pays down
$400 and should pay to the company 60 per cent
a year of the first, second, and third years' crops,
it being understood that the remaining 40 per
cent would remain in the hands of the settler
for the support of his family. But during the
first year it developed that the company took
out of that 40 per cent the interest on the mortgages
and the taxes on the land, so that very
little was left for the cultivator. The next year
the settlers left the land, worked on neighboring
farms for another year, and then returned to
Los Angeles. Some families had lost $400, some
$700&mdash;practically all the money they had saved
or borrowed.</p>

<p>Again, fifteen families made a contract with a
company near Fresno, California. Forty acres
were sold to each family at $115 per acre, with
the privilege of water for irrigation on the stipulation
that the company would receive half of
the market value of the crops. The company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
promised to lend seeds and implements. Several
of the families had come from Mexico to escape
revolutionary disturbances there, bringing implements,
horses, cattle, etc. When they arrived
they had to borrow seeds and provisions for the
support of the families. The company furnished
these on a chattel mortgage at 7 per cent. But
the company was not able to provide irrigating
water, so the settlers, after two years of fruitless
effort, had to leave the land, losing all their
mortgaged personal property. Some families
lost $700 in cash, some lost $1,000, and some
even more.</p>

<p>Later, twenty families made a contract with a
land company for the purchase of farms varying
in size from twenty to forty acres, at a price of
$120 per acre. To be cautious, the peasants sent
out only seven families. The company promised
to provide either a tractor or horses, implements,
seeds, and water, and was to receive one fourth
of the crops. But it turned out that the company
was not able to furnish water. During two years
the settlers tried to make good, but did not succeed,
the lack of water being the main cause of
failure. One family lost $700, another $820, and
the others lost about the same amount each.</p>

<p>Another group of twenty families made a contract
with a company in the same neighborhood.
Fifty acres were sold to each family at $120 per
acre. The company agreed to provide two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
horses for each family and all necessary implements,
and for its part was to receive half of all
the crops. It also promised to give water. But
when the time came the company supplied only
thirty horses instead of forty, and only three
plows for the whole colony; it also failed to furnish
water. The land was good, but without
water it was of no use. The settlers battled for
two years and then left the land. Each lost from
$500 to $1,000.</p>

<p>About two years ago a farmer owning lands in
the San Joaquin Valley got in touch with Russian
peasants in Los Angeles. He agreed to sell these
people land, with houses, stock, etc., at what
seemed a nominal first payment&mdash;$200. It
looked like a wonderful opportunity to the
simple peasants, who, by their industry, had
saved up two or three hundred dollars or more.
About 120 families were induced to make the
first deposit ($10 or $20). Then Prof. W. T.
Clarke of the agricultural extension service of
the University of California was asked by the
Immigration Commission to visit this tract and
report on it. He found that it was the poorest
kind of alkali land&mdash;land that a grasshopper
would starve on. The farmer who was selling
the land raised strenuous objections to the investigation
and the resulting report, but the commission
succeeded in shutting off the entire deal,
except in the cases of four or five peasants who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
insisted on taking the farms and who are
now making a failure of it.</p>

<p>On an attempt of the peasants to settle in
Utah, twenty families contracted to buy farms
at $100 per acre, 130 acres to a family. One
fourth of the crops were to be paid to the company,
which promised to provide water; but the
company failed to find water and all the settlers
and the company itself went to pieces. The
settlers' losses were very heavy, some losing
$1,000, some $2,000. They were again compelled
to return to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In 1907 certain agents of a German sugar
company in Honolulu appeared and promised to
sell the peasants good land in Honolulu. Thirty
families made contracts to buy farms of forty
acres, with the stipulation that they would pay
the price gradually out of their income from the
farms. When the families arrived in Honolulu
there was no land for them. The company explained
that they had been merely hired for work
on its plantation. Under the conditions of labor
there they were half slaves and the life became
unendurable. After six months of trial and
hardship they returned to Los Angeles, each
family having lost from $600 to $700.</p>

<p>In another instance seven families bought
farms at Elmira, California, varying in size
from twenty to seventy acres. The price was
$117 an acre, and they paid down $10 an acre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the balance being covered by a mortgage at 6
per cent. This land is rather poor, but the
settlers have stayed on.</p>

<h3>THE SUCCESSFUL COLONY AT GLENDALE</h3>

<p>Aside from a few families who have succeeded
in settling on land here and there through the
Western states and who are making ends meet,
there is only one group of these peasants which
has succeeded in establishing a well-to-do colony;
that colony is at Glendale, Arizona, below the
Roosevelt Dam.</p>

<p>The first colonists arrived in Glendale seven
years ago from Los Angeles, while others came
later from San Francisco and from Mexico. The
development of the colony has been steady.
There are four groups of colonists located a few
miles from one another, but they communicate
freely and consider themselves one colony.
There are at present about seven hundred persons
in the colony, with an average of five or six
children in each family. The settlers paid down
little money at the beginning. Some families
did not pay anything; some paid $100, some
$500, and a few paid $1,000. The price of the
land was originally $125 per acre, but it has now
doubled. Almost all the land is under cultivation.
The men have acquired the necessary
machinery, stock, plants, and seeds; they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
plenty to eat, and a large number of families
have Ford automobiles, while a few are considering
the purchase of higher-priced cars.</p>

<p>The success of the peasants in Glendale is to
be explained by the fertility of the new desert
land, the adequate irrigation provided by the
Roosevelt Dam system, reasonable conditions
of land purchase, the capacity of the men for
hard labor, and their love of the land. The
main money crop is cotton of the highest grade
and of exceptionally heavy yield. There is no
difficulty in marketing farm products, for the
colony is within a few miles of Ph&oelig;nix.</p>

<h3>OTHER CALIFORNIA CASES</h3>

<p>The report of the Commission on Land Colonization
and Rural Credits of the state of California
presents some interesting cases.
<a name="FNanchor_C_1" id="FNanchor_C_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_1" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>A tract of wheat land was bought at $7 per
acre. The buyer organized a syndicate composed
of himself and his stenographer and sold the land
to the syndicate at $100 per acre. The syndicate
sold the land at $200 per acre. No settler was
able to earn either the purchase price or the
interest on it out of the soil.</p>

<p>Another colonization company bought 150,000
acres at an average of less than $40 per acre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
The average selling price at the start was $75
per acre, but was soon increased to $175 per acre.
The agents commission on the higher price was
30 per cent&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, considerably more than the
cost of the land.</p>

<p>In another case an agent made a contract for
selling a tract of land at 20 per cent of the
selling price, which he was free to fix himself.
He raised the price from $150 to $400 per acre,
so that he received commissions of $80 per acre
instead of $30. As the terms were one fifth cash,
the balance in four yearly installments, the
agent induced the settlers to buy as much land
as would absorb all their capital for the first
payments, and then he pocketed as his commission
the total amount paid down. When the
tract was all sold, the owner held the contracts
of the moneyless settlers, the latter had the use
of the land, and the agent had the coin.</p>

<p>Some colonization companies, in searching for
a tract of land, have regarded price as the only
consideration, saying that any land that could
be bought for $25 an acre could be colonized.
Only hardpan and alkali land could be bought in
California at that price. Nevertheless, one company
bought such an area, subdivided it, and
traded it for houses and lots in Los Angeles.
Some time later only three of the purchasers
were found to be still in the colony, and probably
not one of them intended to remain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
In one district a tract of "goose" land, after
selling for $5 and then $15 an acre, was subdivided
and sold as garden soil for $125 an acre.
Three brothers who were market gardeners
bought farms and settled there with their
families. They found the soil, when wet, to be a
quagmire and when dry to be possible of cultivation
only with dynamite. After three years of
utter failure they were forced to abandon their
homes, having lost their money, time, and labor,
and having reaped a bitter feeling of injustice
and wrong.</p>

<p>It appears from the report that a certain class
of land speculators, when buying land for reselling
in plots, do not pay so much attention to the
qualities of the land as to its advertising possibilities.
If land in a widely known valley is
alkali land, so much the better, for the buying
price is lower. The speculator in his advertisement
makes it appear as fruit land with a great
future. It seems also to have been by no means
uncommon for the agent's commission to be
higher than the price paid by the owner for the
land.</p>

<h3>AN OKLAHOMA SETTLEMENT</h3>

<p>On February 12, 1919, in Cincinnati, Ohio,
sixteen land swindlers of the McAlester Real
Estate Exchange, of McAlester, Oklahoma, were
found guilty by a jury in Federal court. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
company's land-advertisement literature was so
worded as to convey the impression that the
McAlester company was acting as an agent of
the government in the sale of Indian lands. The
prosecution was largely centered on the distribution
among the customers of a tract of 41,000
acres in Oklahoma. It was charged that the
president of the company secured an option on
these lands when he found that he was unable to
buy sufficient land at the government sale of
Indian lands to fill his contracts.</p>

<p>It was also charged that the company perpetrated
a fraud on its customers when it took
$135 as a fee for locating and purchasing land,
agreeing to act as attorney and agent for the
customer, and then sold the land that it had
bought privately at a profit. These contracts
were, in the opinion of the government, so
worded as to convey the impression that in
paying for the locating and bidding the "party
of the second part" was also making a payment
on the land and was encouraged in the belief
that his land would be in the midst of areas yielding
oil and other mineral products as well as
timber. Timber-right frauds also were alleged.
The company had during 1917 collected from its
victims, who lived in all parts of the country,
nearly $1,000,000. It was revealed also that
given plots of land had been sold to more than
one buyer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
The foregoing instances indicate that companies
formed for the purpose of exploiting and
deceiving land settlers have succeeded. With the
increasing tide of new immigration, it may be
possible to ensnare even more unwary persons.
But there have been a sufficient number of expos&eacute;s,
as well as court decisions, to make the
business of fraudulent land promotion a dangerous
one. All types of real-estate dealers are
increasingly realizing the need for making their
transactions aboveboard and honest. Steps to
this end are being taken by the better class of
dealer.</p>

<h2>IV<br />
INDIVIDUAL LAND DEALERS</h2>

<p>Except for government land grants and homestead
acts, land dealing and colonization in the
United States have, up to very recent times,
been entirely in private hands. Land is one of
the necessities of life; land dealing, consequently,
is one of the most important features in social and
economic relations. Yet it has been left unregulated,
with the result that land dealing is now
the most chaotic sort of business, one which has
not worked out its own definite methods, rules,
and traditions, as banking and other branches of
commerce and business have done. It may even
be said that people who deal in land have fallen,
in the eyes of the public, into the ranks of those
open to suspicion.</p>

<p>In the field investigation for this study, land
dealing was considered to be an important phase
of the problem of Americanization in rural districts.
Based upon the experiences and facts
collected, the picture may be drawn as follows:</p>

<p>According to their methods, private land
dealers may be classified as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
(1) Land "sharks," divided between those acting outside
the law and those acting within the law; (2) the ordinary
real-estate dealer&mdash;of two types&mdash;the lower, selfish, narrow-minded,
the higher, public-spirited; (3) "realtors"; (4)
land-colonizing companies.</p></div>

<h3>LAND SHARKS</h3>

<p>Land sharks are of two distinct varieties. One
type is composed of men of a criminal character.
The words "lawful" and "unlawful" have no
meaning for them. They often sell land as their
own which they do not own, or sell land other
than they have promised or even shown to the
buyer. Their only aim is to cheat the latter out
of his money and to escape the penalty of the law.</p>

<p>These pirates injure both land seekers and legitimate
real-estate men. They hang about the
trains, railroad stations, and all points where there
is a chance of attracting the land seekers. They
are sometimes able to entice those who are being
brought in by reputable land men. Often the pirates
are of the same nationality as the immigrants
and by clever emphasis on this common bond and
by skillful manipulation of truth and lies they
steal the men away to look at land which they call
their own. The land pirates do not advertise, but
live on the advertising that the reputable land
men do. As a result the latter curtail their advertising
and do a comparatively small amount of it,
since they are prevented from realizing the full
profits due on the investment. This is a situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
that forces the land men to realize the need
of a licensed real-estate profession.</p>

<p>The president of a land company in Wisconsin
gives this description of the operations of the
land sharks and of the effects of their activity:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Relative to the land pirates, it is hard to estimate how
much land they sell, but we find that for every customer they
do sell to they queer deals for this country of from ten to
twenty-four which the other land men might have landed....
I estimate that within the last two years the city of
---- has lost from fifty to one hundred customers
for land though these pirates, who infest the depot and
meet all trains.... Their first act is to find that the man is
looking for land and to find out whom he is expecting to
see, for they usually come up with some definite proposition
to look over. The pirate then proceeds to throw cold water
on the locality that he is to look over, and very often challenges
the integrity of the party whom he is going to see.
He does this preparatory to starting in to taking the man
off and showing him something of his own. Frequently
these men do not own a foot of land, but have a few pieces
for sale on commission. They are usually irresponsible men
and often put through some rocky deals, and it is through
them more than anything else that the real-estate men have
often got very bad names for the way they have handled
customers who come up to buy land. When the customer's
mind has been poisoned against the party whom he was
coming to see, and against the particular piece of land or
locality where he had formerly planned to buy, he is often
ready to quit and go back, and it is very hard for anyone
thereafter to deal with him, because his confidence has been
shaken in the people and the country.</p></div>

<p>The other type of land shark is composed of
men who act within the law, but, for their own
gain, apply methods which are mildly called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
"sharp" or "unethical." They either misrepresent
the qualities of the land they offer, or
charge a higher price than the land is worth, or
make in the contract such stipulations as will
afterward ruin the settler. They profit by the
settlers' failures, for each settler adds something
to the improvement of the land before the conditions
of the land-purchase contract which he is
unable to meet compel him to leave the land.
The land shark sells the land to a new settler for a
still higher price, capitalizing the improvements
made by the former settler. With the new settler
the process is repeated, and so it goes, like an
endless chain. It is similar to the method of splitting
fees practiced by private employment offices
and foremen who keep men coming and going.</p>

<p>There are no data collected to show the actual
extent of the activities of the land sharks, but,
judging by the stories told by the immigrants, by
records of court proceedings, by suspicious land
advertisements in newspapers, especially in the
smaller, less reliable foreign-language papers, and
by the number of cases brought to the attention
of the state immigration commissioners, it is
safe to state that the immigrants suffer very
greatly from the land-shark evil.</p>

<h3>LOWER TYPE OF LAND DEALER</h3>

<p>One group of the ordinary type of land dealer
might be characterized as being composed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
narrow-minded, hard, and even heartless business
men, working solely for their own interests.
Their business consists merely in buying and
selling land as rapidly as possible. In making
prices for land and in making contract stipulations
with the buyers, they do not "monkey,"
as some of them say. As a rule they do not
charge a higher price than the land is worth&mdash;that
is, not higher than the prevailing market
price in a particular locality. They also avoid
unreasonable or impossible contract stipulations.
When land is sold, when the contract has been
signed by both sides, then their care and interest
in regard to the land and its owner end. If the
buyer later fails to meet the contract stipulations
in any particular the land dealer sees to it that
he leaves the land at once. The dealer then
advertises and sells the land again. Usually, no
compensation for improvements made by the
settler, in case of his failure, is stipulated in the
contract. If there is any gain to the land dealer
from the failure of a settler, the dealer often
claims that such gain is more than offset by
heavy expenses, such as for advertising, agents'
commissions, and the like, in finding a new buyer.</p>

<p>The land dealer gives little or no consideration
to the causes of the failure of the settler. According
to the observation of the writer, a large
number of failures in settling on land are not
due to the personal defects or weakness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
settlers, but are due to external causes, such as
lack of capital and credit, lack of market, poor
roads, etc. The settlers who have failed owing
to such causes might be criticized for their poor
judgment in selecting the land, but the land dealers
might equally be criticized for not warning the
settlers of the difficulties before they buy the land.</p>

<p>The land dealers ought to know the market
facilities, the extent of capital and credit required
for success on a particular piece of land and in a
particular locality. As a matter of fact, dealers
of the type under discussion do not warn the
settlers. They give advice of an optimistic
character and they apply to the settler the Darwinian
theory of survival of the fittest. A
number of these land dealers said to the writer:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, it is up to the settler himself, either to succeed or to
fail. If he fails, he has himself alone to blame, and he must
give place to the settler who is able to succeed. There is
no room for weaklings on my land or anywhere else in this
world.</p></div>

<p>The results which follow in the wake of such
land-settlement policies are described in the
following extract from the letter of a county
agent. He writes from a locality where many of
the settlers are immigrants:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In some parts of this country ... the statistics show that
there is a complete change in the farmers every seven years.
That means that several farmers are coming and going all
the time. Several farmers are paying out taxes and interest
on something they will never own.... As to the land companies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
doing things for the settler, in the most part they
take care of the new man for a time, but I notice that they
close them out, too, if taxes and interest are not kept up
pretty well.</p></div>

<p>A similar condition is described in the letter
below from a county agent in the same state:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The land companies in this county are not putting forth
any special effort to make it easier for the new settlers to
succeed. As far as I know, all the land companies in this
county are reliable. They live up to their agreements with
the settlers. However, I can also vouch for the statement
that many of our farms, with very little clearing, are continuously
changing hands.</p></div>

<p>The importance of advice and warning from
the land company to the settler, and the deplorable
infrequency with which it is given, are spoken
of in this statement by a county agent:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>So far the ... settler's only means of protection has been
the county agent. From the county agent the settler gets
the true condition of the land, climate, and possibilities in
general, of the particular region into which he is going.
Too often, though, the settler is met at the train by the real-estate
agent, and this agent does not let his prospective
buyer get in touch with anyone else until after he has been
sold a piece of land. After the settler has bought his land
the real-estate man thinks that his connection with him
has ceased, and he is no longer interested in him other than
to see that the promised payments are paid when due.</p></div>


<h3>THE PUBLIC-SPIRITED LAND DEALER</h3>

<p>The second group of the ordinary type of land
dealer, though not so large as the first group,
consists of men who have a broader outlook upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
their business and work. While they also are
after personal profit, they understand that they
are rendering, in return for their profit, a service
not only to the land buyer, but also to the public.
Accordingly, they are considerate of the settler,
try to make him successful, and, having the social
point of view, they promote education, welfare
work, and other community interests among the
settlers.</p>

<p>The writer has met a number of such broad-minded
and public-spirited land dealers. Some
of them were so modest as to deny that they
were interested in or were keeping in mind any
public or social end in their business.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Well, I am after profit, nothing more. By helping the
settler to make a success through extension of credit to him,
through demonstrations, through finding a market for his
products, and through organizing community work, I am
only advertising my land and attracting new settlers.
That is, I am applying a little bit of Henry Ford's methods
to the land-settlement business, that's all!</p></div>

<p>This explanation was given by a large land
dealer in one of the Middle Western states.
Further conversation with him showed that he
took great pride in the fact that the settlers on
his land esteemed him highly and had confidence
in him.</p>

<p>It is land men of this type that a county agent
from the North Middle West speaks of in these
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
The land men in this county all believe that it is to their
own interests to have every settler a satisfied settler. They
are getting away from the idea that they are done with the
settler as soon as they sell him a piece of land. They now
believe that they are just starting their relations with the
settler when he buys from them.</p></div>

<p>Another county agent writes that he believes
that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>the real-estate men are beginning to try to see that the settlers
to whom they sell land make good. They are doing
this by being lenient with their conditions and by picking
only the better types of land for settlement.</p></div>

<p>One of the real-estate men who have this more
public-spirited view of their work describes his
relations with the settlers as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I try to assist the settler by giving him all the moral support
and encouragement possible, by keeping friendly with
him so he feels free to come to me with his every problem.
I stand ready to finance any deserving settler for the full
purchase price of good milk cows, or to buy a pig or two,
or for any other thing that is sure to help him over the hill.
Especially, I go among them organizing farm loan associations
and community-center gatherings, thereby bringing
the whole family the general social opportunities that
every normal family craves and has the right to expect.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

    <p class="caption">FRIENDLY ASSISTANCE MAKES PIONEERING LESS BAFFLING<br /></p>
</div>

<p>A real-estate company with offices in Chicago
states that it assists the individual settler in
many ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. We sell him horses and cows on liberal terms.</p>

<p>2. We help him buy on credit building materials and
other necessaries, such as feed for his stock, small tools, etc.
We O.K. many small bills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
3. We many times indorse settlers' notes at banks in
order to help them get credit, and thus get the money with
which to make progress.</p>

<p>4. Our organization keeps in touch with parties to whom
we have sold. Our men see them occasionally and give
them advice. Often we are able to be of material assistance
in helping them to buy the right stock at the right prices.</p>

<p>5. We keep hammering away at the importance of their
keeping in touch with the county adviser and getting the
free literature that is sent out by the state and Federal
authorities.</p>

<p>6. We try to be of aid in everything which promotes the
general social and economic welfare of the community. For
example:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>a. Our Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was chairman of the Liberty Loan Committee
in &mdash;&mdash; County.</p>

<p>b. Any proposition for new roads, new schools, or new
churches gets our hearty and immediate support.</p>

<p>c. In all cases where we have been asked to donate an
acre or half acre for church purposes, we have done
so.</p>

<p>d. We have been instrumental in helping a number of
incipient business men to start cheese factories.</p></div></div>

<h3>"REALTORS"</h3>

<p>Certain phases of the real-estate business requiring
concerted action, and especially the desire
of the higher type of land dealers to put their
trade or profession on a higher level, and thus
to prevent it from falling into disrepute in the
public eye, have led the better type of real-estate
men to organize themselves into local
real-estate boards with an associate membership
of leading local merchants, bankers, lawyers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and others particularly interested in real-estate
developments. The "realtors" prefer to speak
of their trade as a "profession" or "calling,"
not a business or trade, for they claim that an
up-to-date real-estate dealer is a community
builder and leader whose preparation requires a
good general education and a special training,
pointing out that a number of the best colleges
in the country are giving courses in the real-estate
business.</p>

<p>Nineteen local boards from thirteen states
formed a national association in 1908. At
present the association comprises 130 local
boards in this country and Canada, with a total
membership of about 8,500 persons.</p>

<p>The aims of the National Association of Real
Estate Boards are to promote efficiency among
its members, to be a clearing house for the exchange
of information and ideas, to publish an
organ of the association, to broaden the sphere
of influence of the local real-estate men, to
assist in organizing local boards, to fight the
land "sharks" and "curbstone brokers," and to
maintain a high standard of professional ethics.</p>

<p>The members of the associated local boards call
themselves "realtors," as distinct from "real-estate
men" or "land dealers"&mdash;names which,
they feel, are tainted by the unscrupulous
methods of the "sharks."</p>

<p>The association has published a code of ethics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
for its members, in which paragraph 13 is especially
noteworthy. It reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As a duty to the public and each other, members should
report to the board misrepresentations or any fraudulent,
criminal, or illegal act pertaining to real estate, which may
entrap and injure innocent or ignorant persons; and the
board owes it to members and the community to take steps
to stop such practices and to punish parties guilty thereof.</p></div>

<p>The local boards often render certain services
to the community. The valuation committees
are often called upon to give their expert advice
in land matters even to the courts and government
administrative offices.</p>

<p>But how far the association is successful in
combating the underhand business methods of
the unscrupulous real-estate men is very difficult
to say. The fact is this, that the association
favors public registry and regulation of the real-estate
trade and at present is working toward
that end, supporting bills of this nature that are
introduced in the state legislatures. A number
of the realtors are not in favor of the words
"license" and "licensing." They prefer instead
the words "certificate," "registry," and "regulation,"
believing that the word "license" is
associated in the popular mind with saloon-keeping
and similar trades of a lower order.</p>

<p>The desire of these men to separate from ordinary
real-estate men by calling themselves "realtors"
and their business a "profession," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
their advocacy of public regulation, show that
the land "shark" is still very much alive and
that the real-estate men themselves by their own
private efforts are not able successfully to combat
the "shark."</p>

<p>In the field of private land dealing there is
appearing a substitute for the individual dealer.
The modern colonization company has recently
grown up, and out of this new project have
grown broader policies and methods.</p>

<hr class="line" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<h2>V<br />
PRIVATE LAND COLONIZATION COMPANIES</h2>

<p>The earlier so-called city and empire builders
were in most cases nothing more than dealers in
land. When a lot or farm was sold, there the
company's interest ended. The modern colonization
company goes much farther. When a man
settles on land, the company of the better type
usually looks out for him, backs him with credit,
affords him the service of an expert agricultural
adviser, cares for his health, and promotes his
social interests and activities through a salaried
community worker.</p>

<p>All this is done by the company not only for
the sake of the settler himself, but mainly for the
sake of the business interests of the company,
since the success of the settlers on the company's
land is the best advertisement of the company's
business. It creates confidence in the
company among the searchers for land and helps
to increase the volume of business and the profits.
Such companies are of rather recent origin and
as yet are comparatively few in number. Their
appearance means specialization in the land-development
business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
In the North Middle Western states the wilderness
land has been for the most part owned by
the lumber companies. The lumber companies
attempted to dispose of their cut-over and burnt-over
land in the easiest way by selling to individuals.
As a rule this retail selling was unsuccessful.
They found that it was more profitable
for them to stick to their lumber business and
sell their land in large tracts to the land dealers
and to land-development and colonization
companies.</p>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to note that
in the wilds of our north one may still see the
following stages of frontier life as they exist side
by side, sometimes overlapping and crosscutting
one another.</p>

<p>1. The earliest stage known to American
civilization was that of virgin wilderness inhabited
by animals and roamed over by Indians.
As remnants of that time there are found some
animals, now driven into the swamps and rocks,
and a few Indians settled on reservations.</p>

<p>2. The next stage was when the white missionaries,
traders, adventurers, followed by professional
trappers, began penetrating the wilderness.
This white men's hunting stage is still
represented by the present-day "shackers" and
trappers, though they are mostly of an amateur
character, and, so to speak, domesticated.</p>

<p>3. The following stage was when lumbermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
began being heard throughout the forests. They
are still there, though in considerably reduced
numbers. They are hurriedly attacking the remaining
woods, leaving in their wake a dreary,
sorrowful-looking expanse of cut-over and burnt-over
lands.</p>

<p>4. These cut-over lands are now invaded by
the land development and colonization companies,
with their armies of new settlers, attempting
to transform the last remnants of wilderness
into fertile gardens, fields, and meadows. This
is the last decisive war of man upon the wilderness&mdash;a
picturesque and difficult struggle. A
settler gives this vivid description, printed in the
Radisson, Wisconsin, <i>Courier</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Everywhere we go we see men, women, and children cutting
and piling the brush and logs that have covered the
ground since the days of the logger. Everyone seems to be
trying to clear more land than his neighbor, and get it ready
to produce the crops that are so badly needed all over the
world, and as we stop a minute to take a better view of what
each one has done, we hear the boom of dynamite that is
following the brush lines as they are being pushed back.</p></div>

<p>In the north the land-clearing line is called the
firing line, a term which can be taken literally,
for the land-clearing front is continually under
fire and clouds of smoke from burning debris.</p>

<p>5. The sturdy new settlers, the last pioneers
and frontiersmen in the country, are followed,
especially along rivers where water power is
at hand, by industrial workers. Here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
are appearing thriving manufacturing and commercial
towns&mdash;the last stage in the opening up
of a new country to civilization.</p>

<p>But the most important work in the wilderness
at present is that of the modern land colonization
companies. To give an idea of their work
and methods it is necessary to describe one of
these companies in detail.</p>

<h3>A TYPICAL COMPANY</h3>

<p>The particular company investigated with special
attention is located in the wilderness of one of
the North Middle Western states. In general the
company is applying the same business methods
to land colonization as Mr. Ford is applying to
automobile production&mdash;production of new farms
on a large scale so as to diminish the overhead
expense, and standardization of various colonization
methods. The guiding test is the success of
the new settlers on the company's land. Failures
among the settlers are avoided and fought
against by the company as though they were a
dangerous epidemic. "Each failure among our
settlers is a bad advertisement for our company,
a loss to us, and an evidence of defects in our
business methods," stated the company's head.</p>

<p>To insure the success of the settlers and the
settlement, the company proceeds as follows:
The most careful study is made of the tract of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
land which the company intends to acquire for
colonization purposes. Not only is the tract of
land closely looked over by the company's
officials, but land experts, such as soil surveyors,
are engaged to examine the land from the viewpoint
of its agricultural possibilities. Federal
and state surveyors' reports are also used in considering
the possibilities of the land.</p>

<p>When the land has been acquired, a plan for a
colony is worked out, with provision for necessary
roads, town sites, irrigation or drainage systems,
utilization of water power, social centers, experimental
farms, etc. The accompanying map
shows the plan of one such colony.</p>

<p>The tract is then surveyed and cut up into
farms according to the plan adopted. A number
of farm lots are selected by the company. On
each of these lots there is designated a place for
the farm buildings and the garden. A simple,
inexpensive house and a barn are built by the
company on a small clearing, usually facing the
main road. At present the company has ceased
to clear any land for agricultural use for the
reason that if there is a piece of cleared land the
new settler is apt to expend his main efforts on
cultivation of this cleared land, neglecting the
clearing of more land.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Our experience has shown that it is much better when a
new settler begins his settlement enterprise with clearing.
He at once acquires the needed experience in clearing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
develops the confidence that he is able to overcome the
difficulties of clearing. As a result, his ambition grows to
clear more land each year,</p></div>

<p>explained a company official. This again shows
with what fineness the company has to adjust its
methods to the psychological peculiarities of the
settlers.</p>

<p>At the same time the company equips the experimental
farm and puts it into operation under
the supervision of a trained agriculturist. For
the community work a hall is provided and a
community worker engaged.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the company's agents and advertisers
have been busy in making the land opportunities
known to people who are intending to
settle on land. The new settlers are of two
distinct types. One type consists either of native
Americans or immigrants who have previously
been on land in the United States either as landowners
or as tenants. The second class consists
of immigrants who have been living in the cities
and who desire to settle on land. In most cases
they have been engaged in agricultural work in
their old countries.</p>

    <p class="caption">THE WISCONSIN COLONIZATION COMPANY SEES THE NEED OF COMMUNITY CENTERS<br /></p>
</div>

<p>The company itself takes into consideration
racial and national factors. In the year of the
investigation the company was doing its main
business in the one section with Polish immigrants,
and preferred them even to the native
settlers. The reason given was that immigrants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
especially Slavs, are easy to get along with and
readily follow the company's directions and
advice. They are hard workers and are satisfied
with a small return at the beginning. In
contrast, the natives commonly pay little attention
to the company's directions and advice,
being anxious to make a quick success. In case
they do not succeed as rapidly as they expected,
they get discouraged, leave the place, and give
the company a "black eye."</p>

<p>The land is sold in plots of forty acres each,
either as "made-to-order" farms or without
farming improvements&mdash;"land only." The purchaser
may buy as many plots as he desires and
is able to pay for. However, the company
discourages the buying of more land than the
settler is able actually to improve and cultivate,
which usually is about forty acres.</p>

<p>The company offers in its folder the following
three land sale plans:<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">PLAN NO. 1<br />
<span class="smcap">Land Only, without Improvements</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>First payment, $200 for each 40 acres. Total cost, $750
to $1,000 for each 40 acres.</p>

<p>If you buy under Plan No. 1 you pay for the land only.
Should you want lumber or building supplies, we will furnish
them to you at cost, and add on to your contract. The same
is true in case you want live stock. In other words, we will
furnish supplies equal to the amount of the first payment.
Prices vary according to location and quality of land.</p>

<p>As experience has shown, a settler on new land
which he has to clear has no opportunity for using
a horse to its fullest capacity during the first
two years. Therefore the company does not
include a horse in the preliminary equipment of
a "made-to-order" farm. When a new settler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
needs horse power either for plowing or hauling
he hires a horse from his older neighbors or from
the company's demonstration farm at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>One of the company's special efforts consists
in securing a market for the settler's produce.
With this end in view, co-operative creameries
are favored and promoted by the company.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the company to encourage
the organization of local state banks wherever it
does any colonizing work, for the company
realizes that the short-time credit needs of the
settlers must be taken care of. It always encourages
the local merchants and people in the
near-by towns to take some stock in the bank.
Whatever stock is left over, different members
connected with the company usually take, upon
an understanding with the local people that as
soon as any of them wish some of this stock the
company will sell it to them at 6 per cent interest
on its money.</p>

<p>A number of years ago the company organized
a bank in one of its colonies in order that the
settlers might get proper credit. The company
found it necessary to do something, as heretofore
the settlers had had no opportunity to secure
short-time credit. After the bank had been
organized for three years the people in the colony
desired to take the bank stock, and the men connected
with the colonization company sold all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
their stock with the exception of one or two
hundred dollars each, which the local people
desired that they retain, so that out of $10,000
capital stock $1,000 is held by men interested
in the company. In another colony some of the
local people spoke for some stock and were
offered the stock held by men interested in the
colonization company at exactly what they paid
for it, plus 6 per cent interest on their money.
This has been true in the different sections where
the company has promoted the organization of
a bank.</p>

<p>As the company's business methods are based
upon the principle of the settler's success, the
company is keeping in very close touch with its
settlers. For each settler a "Progress Record"
card is filed in the company's local office. The
following reproduction of the main features of the
card indicates the items that show the economic
progress of the settler. Although it is not possible
to have all the items filled up to date, a
beginning is always made. As visits are made
to the settlers' farms by the company's representatives,
or the settlers come to the company
office for advice or help, information is collected
and added to the cards. Eventually an
invaluable record of salient facts in regard to the
settler and his progress is accumulated in this
way.</p>

<p>These progress records are valuable to the
company for a number of purposes. They help
in considering extension of credit, in giving advice
to the settlers, and in finding out what
general business methods are the best for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
company to follow in the way of assisting the
settler to make a success.</p>

<p>As the settler's future well-being depends to a
certain degree upon his progress in Americanization,
it would be advisable for the company to
include in the record cards items concerning the
date of the settler's arrival in America, his
naturalization status, and the degree of his
knowledge of English at the time of his settlement
on land. These few additional items would
hardly complicate or burden the recording work
of the company's local office.</p>

<h3>THE ADVISER</h3>

<p>The company's officials stated that the immigrant
family when first arriving in the colony
is shy and helpless. The introduction of the
family to the new conditions and surroundings
has to be made gradually. A representative of
the company meets the family at the station
and directs it to a hotel, where it stays a few
days before it is taken to the farm. During
these several days the company's adviser calls
often upon the family, talks with its members,
takes them through the colony and introduces
them to their future neighbors, and explains the
local conditions. When the family is transferred
to the farm the company's adviser still has to
call almost daily, for there are numerous matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
upon which the settler needs advice and
encouragement.</p>

<p>The majority of the new settlers are quite
ignorant of the methods of land clearing. This
the adviser has to teach them. How to feed
cows, what and when to plant, how to cultivate,
and how to handle the products&mdash;in all such
questions the new settlers need constant direction.
They themselves give two reasons for their
need of advice in farming operations. First, the
European methods of farm work are different
from the American methods, especially because
in Europe they were not engaged in opening up
new land. Secondly, having been engaged in
industrial work in America, often for long years,
they have forgotten the European farm experience
to a certain degree.</p>

<p>While the writer was in the office of the adviser
the settlers were constantly calling upon
the latter for advice in all sorts of matters. One
woman came, crying, and said, through her boy
as interpreter, that her cow was sick and perhaps
dying. Another woman sought advice as to her
sick baby. A man came to ask that a certain
road be extended to his place. Still another man
wanted to do some stumping on his land in co-operation
with his neighbors, provided the company
lent a machine and the adviser came to
direct the work. Another man asked advice in
regard to the extension of credit to him. So the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
stream of inquiries went on continually. The
adviser needed to be, as he was, an extremely
capable man to deal with the extraordinary list
of demands. He was an expert agriculturist,
energetic, and in love with the game of helping
the immigrant settlers.</p>

                       FOR ITS NEWLY ACQUIRED SHROPSHIRE EWES<br /></p>
</div>

<p>In regard to the need of a trained adviser for
the new settlers the president of the company
explained as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The greatest need for instruction is in land clearing, for
the modern land-clearing methods&mdash;methods of just how to
"brush," and at what time of year to conduct the operations&mdash;are
entirely new to almost every settler arriving in the
colony. No wonder we ourselves are studying, experimenting,
and improving on land-clearing methods each month.</p>

<p>In general, our immigrant colonists are efficient workers.
The fact is that some of the buildings in our new town site
are being built by our settlers. A large number of them
were contractors. Many of the foreigners worked in the
shipyards on the coast. Some of them worked on big farms.
We find them very intelligent and capable, and some of
them very good business men. We have built over twenty
miles of road this year, every bit of it being done under
contract, and the contracts were all taken by our new
settlers. During the past year about two hundred houses
were built, and these were all contracted to the new settlers.</p>

<p>It is true they have many things to learn, just as we have.
We are not really teaching them, but we are working with
them, studying with them, learning much from them, just
as they learn from us. We are opening up our demonstration
farms, studying the problems just as they are. Our
adviser's main work is to assist them in choosing the kind
of seed best adapted to that country, to act as a kind of
leader for the community, for they are all strangers, and
until they have become accustomed to the country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
until leaders have sprung up among them, it is necessary
that an outside leader, such as our agricultural adviser,
should be employed, but not because of the ignorance or
inefficiency of the foreigners.</p></div>

<p>Observing the actual operations of such advisers
in a number of cases, the writer has been
convinced that in every new rural immigrant
colony an intelligent, sympathetic, and efficient
adviser is needed, and that the private colonization
companies are to be commended for employing
such advisers.</p>

<h3>CHILDREN OVERWORKED</h3>

<p>In one of the colonies the writer observed that
the settlers' children worked a great deal. On
one farm three children&mdash;two boys and one girl&mdash;of
ages varying from nine to thirteen or fourteen,
were clearing land of stones and the debris
of brush and stumps. On another farm, the
settler's wife, with her two tiny and delicate girls,
was cultivating potatoes, each one using a rake.
On a third farm, two boys, one of ten and the
other of twelve, were cutting hay with scythes.
The boys were thin and pale. In talk they appeared
serious and somewhat cheerless, although
in a measure enthusiastic about their new farm.</p>

<p>The company's local officials and also the
settlers themselves admitted that their children
work considerably, even to the extent that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
are often kept home from school. The settlers
said that they understood the harm being done
their children both by working too hard and by
being withdrawn from school. But they are very
eager to put their new farms on a paying basis
in the shortest possible time. The company's
officials said that they had so far not interfered
with the use of child labor, but that in the future
they would try to exercise some supervision over
the work of children in the colony.</p>

<p>The president of the company stated in regard
to the labor of the settlers' children that "in
some cases in the cities, on the farms, and
everywhere, there is an indiscreet use of child
labor, as also there is a practice in many communities
of letting the children run wild. I believe
I would rather trust future America to
those brought up in pioneer regions than I would
trust future America to those brought up under
conditions where no hardship, no pioneering, no
work whatever is expected of them."</p>

<p>While this is quite true, nevertheless the
writer's impression was that a number of the
settlers overwork their children and keep them
out of school at times.</p>

<h3>SECURING CREDIT</h3>

<p>As the company's overhead expenses for the
maintenance of a number of offices, for the employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of a large number of agents and for commissions
and extensive advertising, are heavy,
the company is able to do successful business
only on a very large scale. The head of this
particular company believed that, in view of
this fact, the tract of good farming land on which
a company operates must be not less than 50,000
acres. He also stated that in view of the fact
that the company's outlay of money, and
especially its extension of credit to settlers, is
very large, the reliable land development and
colonization companies ought to be assisted in
the way of credit by the public through the
government.</p>

<p>During the war the company had great difficulty
in borrowing money on the settlers'
mortgages. They had to pay a high rate
of interest. Since the end of the war, however,
the company has been able through the
banks of the financial centers of the North
Middle West to float a large number of collateral
bonds on mortgages. These bonds at
the present time sell to the general public at
6 per cent. The company, its president stated,
must pay the cost of trusteeship commission
on sale of bonds, etc., which brings the rate
which the company pays to a fair amount above
the 6 per cent which the ultimate investor receives.
At the present time there is no difficulty
in financing the organization, although it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
be very desirable to have state and Federal
assistance.</p>

<p>Bills providing for such assistance have been
introduced in the state legislatures of all of the
northwest states. Congressman Knutson at
Washington has introduced a land credit bill to
provide capital for the development by land
colonization of the agricultural resources of the
nation, providing for certain privileges to soldier
settlers, and creating a National Colonization
Board.<a name="FNanchor_D_1" id="FNanchor_D_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_1" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<h3>CONSERVATION OF WOODED LAND</h3>

<p>While the company has made provision for the
conservation of riparian rights, for roads, and even
for town sites, it has done little for the conservation
of wooded land. It has preserved the woodland
on river banks and 160 acres of timber in
one colony, and it has planted about 15,000
small pine trees. Moreover, the company encourages
the conservation of woodland by the
settlers, advising them to keep in timber from
five to ten acres for each farm.</p>

<p>How far the settlers will follow this good advice
remains to be seen, while the conservation of
wooded land by the company is inadequate.
This the company's local officials admitted, but
they reasoned that it would hardly be advisable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
for a single company, or even a number of companies,
to attempt to conserve wooded land or
other natural resources the return from which
would be in the far distant future. It would be
advisable for the state, or even for the Federal
government, to make provisions and necessary
regulations for the conservation of wooded land
and other natural resources upon which the well-being
of the public at large depends.</p>

<h3>THE SIZE OF A COLONY</h3>

<p>A number of Polish settlers in one of the colonies
visited expressed the desire to have a Polish
church and school. They believed that if the
national Catholic Church organization would
help them, they themselves would be able to
maintain their church and school.</p>

<p>This fact led the writer to a discussion with the
company's officials as to the advisable size of a
compact colony of the same nationality. They
stated that if an immigrant family is established
among settlers of another nationality, the family
becomes lonely and desperate and after a year
or two of such loneliness is apt to leave the
farm, no matter how successful it has been in
buying and cultivating the land. Therefore the
company's policy is to settle the people of the
same nationality together.</p>

<p>The writer asked whether, if a colony of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
nationality is large, having a hundred or several
hundred families, the resulting conditions would
not make for separation and isolation. They
would have intimate intercourse only with one
another, would establish a church and school of
their own nationality, and would even develop
their own town and elect their own local government
officials. The company's officers admitted
that this would possibly happen; they said that
the company had not yet decided how large a
colony of one nationality, in the same locality
or neighborhood, it would develop.</p>

<p>The personal opinion of one of the officials
was that from fifteen to twenty-five families of
one nationality in the same neighborhood would
not be a source of danger because of becoming
clannish and remaining un-Americanized for a
generation or a number of generations. A colony
of such size would not be able to maintain a
church and school of its own nationality. As to
the danger of inbreeding, the officials pointed out
that the church rules and state laws would prohibit
it, and said that, furthermore, the immigrants,
having friends and acquaintances elsewhere
in the country, would marry into other
groups of immigrants.</p>

<h3>LEARNING AMERICAN WAYS</h3>

<p>The writer, while visiting the company's colonies,
was struck by the fact that the settlers who said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
they had been in this country from eight to
ten years understood and spoke very little English,
seemed to be rather shy, and in general
appearance lacked signs of American influence.
Overalls and the tools in their hands were almost
the only betraying marks of the American
environment.</p>

<p>The investigation developed the fact that
most of the settlers had lived previously in the
congested "Little Polands" in Chicago, Detroit,
and Milwaukee. The settlers explained that they
lived there as in the old country, having their
own Polish church, Polish schools, Polish banks,
Polish stores, Polish books and papers, speaking
Polish in their homes, in the streets, and in social
gatherings. Even in the factories where they
worked, their fellow workers were often Poles;
sometimes even the foreman was a Pole. There
was almost no opportunity for coming in contact
with the American ways of life and with the
country's language.</p>

<p>Several settlers declared that they had learned
more about America and had used English more
during the last two years in the northern wilderness
than during the previous seven or eight years
in the city of Chicago. Settling on land, they
came in contact with the American land agents,
other company officials, government authorities,
American banks and stores, and with American
neighbors at the community meetings. Here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the wilderness they first found how badly they
needed English and a knowledge of American
ways. A number of parents started to learn
English by taking lessons from their children,
who themselves were learning English in the
local public schools.</p>

<p>The company's officials stated, in confirmation,
that the Polish settlers in their colonies were
growing in dignity and self-reliance, that they
were assuming American characteristics and an
American bearing.</p>

<h3>TWO POINTS OF VIEW</h3>

<p>As the colonies of the company are comparatively
young, it is impossible to foresee their future
with certainty. So far they seem to be on a
sound basis, and their success rather than their
failure is to be expected. The soil is good and
the settlers stick hard to their work on the land.
The first colony founded seems to be over the
danger line already. It is no longer under the
financial control of the company, the settlers
have secured loans outside, and their farms are
progressing from the experimental stage to that
of established security.</p>

<p>However, a settler expressed the following
apprehension to the writer:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You see us, men and women, old and young, working here
in the wilderness like beavers, clearing and digging, scraping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and building. All are pressed hard by a strong hope of
establishing a permanent home and of earning future independence.
But we still live in makeshift houses, and so far
only a few families are able to make a living, bare and
meager, out of their clearings, diggings, and cows. The vast
majority&mdash;almost all of us&mdash;have, at times, to leave the
farm in care of women and children and look for work
elsewhere&mdash;in Duluth, Chicago, Detroit&mdash;for the purpose of
earning bread for the family on the farm. A number temporarily
hire out to the company, but the latter's wages are
considerably less than we get in the industrial centers.</p>

<p>You have heard the company's officials and seen their
doings, and everything might seem to you to work smoothly
for the benefit of the settlers. Is it not so? For instance,
the company claims that it sells us tools at cost, but we
already have found out in regard to a number of things that
the company makes a fair profit on them. Again, the company
claims that it runs the demonstration farms only for
our benefit, but as a matter of fact the company's aim is, as
we understand it, to build up a large farm estate on the best
land of the tract, and to sell us its products, seeds, breeding
stock, etc.; in other words, to make money out of demonstration.
One hardly can object to this, except that the
company claims that it is doing business with us "at cost,"
which is not so.</p>

<p>Almost in everything, even in our home life, we depend
upon the good will of the company, and so far we have not
much complaint to make against it. In general, it has
treated us well under the existing circumstances, but we are
a little apprehensive about our future. Suppose we, as
settlers, finally succeed in making good, clear our land, and
build up our farms, as expected by the company and hoped
by ourselves. Will we then be free and independent of the
company's control? We are afraid not. We will still have
to transact our financial matters through the bank in which
the company is interested, sell our products through the
company's agency, etc., not because any law or stipulation
would require this, but solely because the company, with
all its business establishments, is here among us. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
company is retaining river shores, town sites connected with
certain business privileges, and the best pieces of land, as
its demonstration farms. This means that the company,
with its fatherly care for us, is going to remain with us for
a long time to come.</p></div>

<p>The field notes of the writer on the above
statements of the settler were later shown to
the company's head, who answered them as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The expression "makeshift houses" is not fitting at all,
for the buildings are warm and comfortable&mdash;hardwood
floors, painted wall board inside. They are small, it is true.
You can travel the country over, where pioneers are located,
and I defy anyone to find a better-looking set of houses than
those in any one of our colonies.</p>

<p>This man states that so far only a few families are able to
make a living. In our older colonies I could show a list of
cream checks which the different settlers are receiving from
their cows; they will range all the way from $50 to $400 a
month. This does not take into consideration the surplus
live stock, potatoes, and other grains, which they sell from
their farms. It is not expected that these new settlers will
make money out of their crops for the first few years. It
is expected that they will go away to the cities and work
part of the time, while their families remain on the land.
We state in our literature, as does all state literature, that
the first two or three years contain hardships, and mean
some working out to earn money, provided the settler comes
without any funds whatever. The survey of all our settlers
shows that while they have worked in the city ten to fifteen
years, their entire savings have amounted to from $200 to
$1,000. In the colonies, due to clearing, increased value of
land, and earnings on their new farms, they have made from
$500 to $1,000 a year. Surely this entails some hardship
and some hard work.</p>

<p>The statement that some of them hired out to the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
at less wages than are paid in industrial centers I'll agree
was true during war times. We could not hope to compete
with the wages paid in the munition factories of the East.
The company does, however, pay standard wages, as high
as are paid anywhere for the same class of labor.</p>

<p>The statement that the company claims that it sells the
necessities at cost is not correct, for the company sells nothing.
We have an iron-bound practice that in no case do
we enter into the store or sales business. We furnish the
original house, barn, tools, live stock, with the land. After
that we sell nothing. We have often stated that if we would
enter into the store business or selling business, it would
drive others out, and it was poor practice for the company
to engage in any business outside of colonization, for it
involved too much detail and was a separate business.
Colonization is a game all of itself, and if we divided our
energies with other industries we could not succeed.</p>

<p>Some time ago a charge similar to this was made by some
of the settlers, stating that the company was making profits
on buildings. We immediately offered to have any lumber
company agree to put up those buildings for the same price
that we did. We asked for a large number of bids, and the
nearest bid was one hundred and twenty-five dollars more
than the price we were charging the settlers. We did not
ask them to bid on only one house, but on one hundred
houses a year. The reason we have been able to construct
these buildings at such a low rate is that we have our own
timber. When the price of lumber went up during war
times, we did not increase our price one dollar. By building
hundreds of houses each year, by eight or ten years of experiment,
and keeping the same foreman and crew, we have
been able to develop an efficiency that will allow us to put
these buildings up at one hundred dollars less than the best
bid we could get from anyone. We would gladly give up
this detail work if some one else could do it, for we make no
money on it and barely take care of costs and our necessary
overhead.</p>

<p>As to furnishing cattle, we made an offer to one of the
local Holstein and Guernsey associations, asking them if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
they would be willing to furnish all of our settlers cows at
the same price we were asking, and deliver them at the
same time we were delivering them; we could not get anyone
to accept our offer. We have lost money right along
on our live stock&mdash;not a great deal, but a small amount. So
when your informer tells you that they purchase goods from
the company at a fair profit to the company, the statement
is not correct, for we sell no goods to them at all except
what goes with the land. In no case do we buy anything
from the settlers, and in no case do we sell anything to
them, except the original equipment which goes with the
original purchase.</p>

<p>The statement that the company's purpose is to reserve
large demonstration farms is laughable, for we only have
two demonstration farms reserved in our entire tract of
60,000 acres. Those two demonstration farms cover 2,500
acres. Already one demonstration farm in a colony where
we sold practically all the land has been cut up into small
farms and offered for general sale. The other demonstration
farm is in the vicinity of our present settlement and is
not now broken up.</p>

<p>In our oldest colony we reserve not a foot of land there.
The cheese factory which we started we turned over to the
co-operative organization. The warehouse which we constructed
we turned over to a Co-operative Shippers' Association.</p>

<p>There is one thing that your informant is correct on,
and that is that we retain the river shores. We have retained
the riparian rights for the reason that some day we hope to
turn this over to a water-power company and develop hydroelectric
power for the benefit of that whole community. If
these river shores were in the hands of different settlers, it
would be impossible for a hydroelectric company ever to
go in there and purchase each farm separately at a price
that would enable it to develop the power.</p></div>

<p>The contradictions in the above interviews are
to be explained by the settlers' misunderstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of the company's general policy and methods.
In their eyes everything in the colony belongs to
and is managed by the company, which is quite
true at the beginning of the colony, and which
cannot be otherwise at that time. The new
settlers know little of one another, and are ignorant
of the local conditions. They lack both
business experience and capital. Therefore, as
a rule they are not able to conduct, either individually
or on a co-operative basis, commercial
or industrial establishments at the start. It is
therefore up to the company to see that there is a
town, a hotel, a grocery store, a bank, a creamery,
or cheese factory, a shipping office, etc., in the
colony.</p>

<p>The fact that the company has interests in,
and even controls, these concerns at the beginning,
and that all these business branches work
together, conducting their financial transactions
through the same bank, has led the settlers to
believe that everything is permanently owned
and controlled by the company. The settlers in
a new colony do not know that as soon as the
success of these business organizations is secure
and the settlers have been assisted to a firmer
footing the company will turn the organizations
over to the settlers themselves on a co-operative
basis, as has already been done in the company's
oldest colony. It is the company's policy, as
above stated by its head, to specialize in the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
colonization work only, leaving banking, commerce,
and manufactures to others.</p>

<h3>COLONY SNAPSHOTS</h3>

<p>The writer visited and investigated two colonies
of new settlers founded by the colonization company
within a distance of about twenty to thirty
miles from one another. The following field
notes taken during interviews with the company's
local officials and the settlers themselves
give a general picture of the conditions of the
colonies.</p>

<p>In the first colony, the first families settled
about twelve to fifteen years ago. At that time
a logging camp was operating and the country
was covered with standing timber. As fast as
the loggers cleared the timber the land was
opened for settlement by the colonization company.
Land buyers were taken into the logging
camp, were given meals and sleeping quarters
there, and were taken out and shown their land.
About five years after the first settlers came most
of the timber had been cut. The company then
established the village and began settling from
that point. The colony has steadily increased
and at present contains about fifty families.</p>

<p>The settlers were Polish. About ten families
came from Russia, twenty from Germany, and
twenty from Austria. They left their old country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
on account of poverty, political oppression,
and compulsory military service there. Almost
all of them had been engaged in agriculture in
the old country. About forty families had been
employed in shops and factories in America
before they succeeded in settling on land here;
only about ten families came from Europe directly
to the colony, of which they learned
through the company's advertisements in the
American-Polish newspapers and also through
the letters of their friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>The largest farm is 120 acres, the smallest 20
acres, and the average 80 acres. Most of the
farms are still under mortgage, only a few being
cleared of debt.</p>

<p>In the colony and its vicinity are seven schools:
six with one room and one with three rooms. All
teachers are native born and all teaching is in
English. The settlers appreciate education.
Most of the children are inclined to farming
and will remain in the colony. One fourth
of the adults do not speak English, one half
only speak English, and one fourth speak and
write English.</p>

<p>Only a few of the adult male settlers have
second papers; about nine tenths have first
papers, while the rest are totally unnaturalized.
In explanation of this fact the company's president
stated that it is only the older men who
have not secured even their first papers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
A large proportion of the foreign settlers [he said] secure
their second papers just as rapidly as they can after they
locate on the land. They desire to take part in local politics;
they find that they must become interested in local political
affairs if they wish to have a good system of schools, roads,
and gain the other advantages which both the county and
town can give them. They are also interested in the state
politics. All this brings the question of second papers
forcibly to their minds, and in an accurate survey of the
different colonies we are interested in, you will find that a
large per cent of those who have been on the land five years
or more have already secured their second papers. One of
the difficulties which hinder them from getting their second
papers sooner is the fact that they must have some one
certify that he has actually known them for a period of
five years. Coming as they do, strangers from another
state, it is necessary that they live among us for a five-year
period before such an affidavit can be secured. I have had
many of the settlers speak to me, desiring second papers,
but they were forced to wait their period before they could
secure them.</p></div>

<p>Most of the settlers read the Polish newspapers
published in America. Quite a number of families
take books from the school libraries; among
these are a few Polish books&mdash;stories and
histories.</p>

<p>The settlers are of the Roman Catholic faith.
They attend a local church. Their Catholic
neighbors of other nationalities attend the same
church. The priest is of the Polish nationality;
he cannot speak English well. He is appointed
by the bishop. The settlers would prefer to
elect their priest themselves.</p>

<p>While the houses are of the American type,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the interior arrangement of the living rooms
remains that of the European Slavic peasantry&mdash;the
bedcover is often fancy handiwork, the
walls are profusely covered with family photographs,
pictures of Polish heroes, and magazine
illustrations. However, an honored place is
given to the picture of the President and the
American flag. Furniture is placed against the
wall around the room. The premises are kept
comparatively clean and in order.</p>

<p>Diet is rather mixed, though the Polish meals
and the Polish ways of cooking predominate.
The settlers claim that their housewives are
more frugal than the American housewives in
their neighborhood.</p>

<p>There are very few intermarriages; nationality
alone is considered a drawback for intermarriage
between a Pole and non-Pole. In cases where
the two people are of different faith, the Church
is another drawback.</p>

<p>Family discipline, in respect to the authority
of the husband as the family head, is less strict
than in the old country. The settlers believe
that this is due to the American influence. Here
the husband has to consult his wife in every important
question and the children are not so
often punished.</p>

<p>The relations between the colonists and the
national groups in the neighborhood are generally
friendly and help is given mutually in cases of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
need. But there is very little social visiting between
the groups, the difference in nationality
being a bar.</p>

<p>The settlers secure agricultural advice from
two sources&mdash;the company's adviser and the
county agent. They raise wheat, rye, oats, potatoes,
grasses&mdash;clover and timothy&mdash;while their
main income is derived from milk production.</p>

<p>The products are sold to the local agents;
there is no discrimination in prices. Necessities
are bought in the near-by towns, prices being too
high and goods not always suited to the needs of
the settlers.</p>

<p>Money is loaned by the local banks at 7 to 8
per cent. This rate, the company stated, was
on short-time, unsecured paper. The settlers,
it maintained, have always been able to secure
money on farm mortgages at 6 and 7 per
cent.</p>

<p>Economically stronger families compel their
children to do chores and work in the field outside
of school time, while poorer and weaker
families, especially those of more recent settlers,
often let their children work even during school
time.</p>

<p>The settlers are satisfied with their conditions
and they all desire to remain permanently in
America. The only thing they want is an increase
in the number of settlers and further
development of their locality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
The second colony
<a name="FNanchor_D_2" id="FNanchor_D_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_2" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
visited by the writer was
started by the company the year before (1917).
There are now about sixty Polish families in the
colony. Half of the adult male population were
deserters from the compulsory military service
in Russia, Germany, and Austria. "Why should
we have served in the armies by which Poland
was oppressed!" exclaimed a settler when asked
as to their justification for desertion.</p>

<p>Before settling on the land they all had worked
in steel mills, factories, mines, etc., some five to
six years, some longer, but their experience in
Europe had been on farms. While in America
they had learned of the land from the company's
advertisements in the Polish papers. In regard
to the settlers' previous farming experience the
company's head said that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>our company will not sell land to any settler who has not
had some farm experience. We advise them first to work
on a farm somewhere&mdash;either rent it or hire out&mdash;until they
have gained the necessary experience to make them successful
on their farms. These people here are not factory workers,
but are primarily farmers, land hungry, who came to
this country for the purpose of owning a home, and only
temporarily worked in steel mills, factories, and mines, in
order to secure sufficient money to get the start that they
so much desire.</p></div>

<p>About ten settlers had gone, at the time of the
writer's visit, to work in Duluth and Chicago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Their families and other settlers were busily
engaged in land clearing. The smallest clearing
was 6 acres, the largest 20 acres, and the average
clearing for each farm was 10 acres&mdash;that is,
about one sixth of the land was already cleared,
but most of the cleared land was not yet turned.
The size of the largest farm was 120 acres, that
of the smallest 40 acres, and of the average 60
acres. In May the company organized a land-clearing
contest among the settlers of its colonies,
providing rewards for the winners. "This was a
big event in our colony&mdash;the men pushed the
brush for all they were worth," said the company's
agent.</p>

<p>The settlers estimated that all of the adult
males understand English, and that about 70 per
cent can also speak English, though not well, while
not one can intelligibly write English. Most of
the adult women do not even understand English.</p>

<p>There is no Polish church. Once in two or
three weeks a Polish priest comes. The majority
of the settlers do not care about having a Polish
church and school. They claim that their religious
sentiment is weaker in America than it
was in Europe.</p>

<p>Their diet is almost entirely Polish. Some
families keep their homes clean and in order;
some continue to live in dirt as in Europe.</p>

<p>Relations between the Polish and non-Polish
settlers are good, though no social visiting takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
place. Still, they meet and see one another at
the community hall, about which the settlers
seemed to be enthusiastic.</p>

<p>In clearing land the settlers have so far applied
hand labor almost exclusively, but in the coming
year horse power will be needed. Near the
houses small potato patches and vegetable gardens
have been planted. Field crops have been
started, in a small and primitive way, and among
these oats and feed grasses predominate. The
sale of milk is the most important item of income
of the settlers. Dairy farming is the company's
aim in the development of the colony.</p>

<p>In regard to the clearing of land the company
emphasized the point that the land does not all
have to be cleared in order to produce.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Cattle are immediately turned into the brushland, and
can pasture upon the brush, the native grasses, and the
clover which grows throughout the entire region. Land
which is cleared is used for winter food products. Summer
feed for the cattle, hogs, and horses comes almost exclusively
from the uncleared land. By following dairying and live-stock
raising, the entire land becomes productive at once,
while grain or vegetable farming would mean that only the
land under cultivation would be producing.</p></div>

<p>The men of the colony seemed to be rather
cheerful and hopeful, while their wives impressed
the writer as being somewhat downcast and self-centered.
Several of them said that they have
to work much harder in the colony than in the
cities or even in the old country.</p>

<h2>VI<br />
PUBLIC LAND COLONIZATION</h2>

<p>California is the first, and so far the only state
in the Union to undertake the public colonization
of land. Its first experiment is very recent and
on a comparatively small scale. Its leaders are
ably utilizing their knowledge of the experiences
in public land colonization in foreign countries
such as Australia, New Zealand, the Scandinavian
states, and Great Britain. Although it
is impossible to foresee the outcome, the writer
is inclined to believe that the public land colonization
in California will continue to be a success,
giving impetus to similar projects in other states.</p>

<h3>THE CALIFORNIA EXPERIMENT</h3>

<p>The California experiment and its history may
be outlined briefly as follows: A report of the
California Commission on Land Colonization
and Rural Credits made in 1916 revealed the
fact that few settlers were coming to California
and that many who had come were leaving
because of hardships created by high prices of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
land, high interest rates, and short terms of payment
given in colonization contracts. As a result,
the California legislature passed the Land
Settlement Act, approved June 1, 1917,
<a name="FNanchor_E_1" id="FNanchor_E_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_1" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> for the
purpose of</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>promoting closer agricultural settlement, assisting deserving
and qualified persons to acquire small improved farms, providing
homes for farm laborers, increasing opportunities
under the Federal Farm Loan Act, and demonstrating the
value of adequate capital and organized direction in sub-dividing
and preparing agricultural land for settlement.</p></div>

<p>The act appropriated $250,000 for a demonstration
in state land colonization, fixing 10,000
acres as the limit which should be bought. The
land might be situated in one or two localities,
but not profitably in more, because of the increase
in overhead expenses. To carry out the
provisions of the act a state Land Settlement
Board was appointed of which Prof. Elwood
Mead was chairman. The board was organized
at the end of August, 1917, and immediately
began the search for a suitable tract of land.
With the advice of technical experts of the University
of California and of other authorities
upon soil, irrigation, health, and various conditions
which would affect the success of the
colony, final selection was made of a tract at
Durham, Butte County, California.</p>

<p>On May 7, 1918, the land was finally transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to the state. Prior to this, however, the
land had been subdivided and had been prepared
for farming, a large acreage having even
been seeded. On May 15th, 3,421 acres were
offered to settlers, consisting of 53 farms, ranging
in size from 3&nbsp;<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> acres to 160 acres, and of 21
two-acre farm laborers allotments. The prices
of the farms varied from $875 (above which the
next price was $3,646) to $14,942. The price of
the farm laborers' allotments was $400. The law
provided that the value of the former, without
improvements, should not exceed $15,000, and
that of the latter, without improvements, should
not exceed $400. The terms of sale were as
follows:</p>

<p>Settlers were to pay 5 per cent of the cost of
the land and 40 per cent of the cost of the improvements
at the time of purchase, the remainder
of the purchase price to be paid over a
period of twenty years with interest at the rate
of 5 per cent per annum. Payments of principal
and interest were to be made semiannually in
accord with the amortization table of the Federal
Farm Loan Board.</p>

<p>All applicants for land were carefully considered
as to their character and their fitness for
farming. The minimum amount of capital a
settler was required to have was fixed at $1,500
or a working equipment of equal value. A farm
laborer was not required to have any capital, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
had only to pay the initial deposit of $20 and
semiannual payments of about $15.</p>

<p>The board reserved the right of supervision of
the methods of cultivation of each settler, of the
state of repair of buildings, of fire-insurance
policies, and of other details.</p>

<p>Plans of houses and barns were prepared and
the board offered to build these, or others, for
the settler, on payment of 40 per cent of the cost.
An engineer was employed to supervise the erection
of buildings and to help settlers plan the
grouping of buildings, orchard, garden, and field.
The board bought material at wholesale and let
contracts in groups and in this way each family
was saved much money and valuable farming time.</p>

<p>The board kept the following objects in view:</p>

<p>1. That the settlement become widely and
favorably known as the home of one breed of
dairy cattle, one breed of beef cattle, one breed
of hogs, and one or two breeds of sheep.</p>

<p>2. The co-operation of the settlers in buying
and selling.</p>

<p>3. The establishment at Durham, or on the
settlement, of a training school in agriculture.</p>

<p>4. The erection in the near future of a social
hall owned and paid for by settlers.</p>

<p>Co-operative action among the farmers and
farm laborers was particularly desired and encouraged.
A co-operative stock breeders' association
was formed. Twenty-two acres were reserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
for community use, and here it is hoped
that community buildings will be erected.</p>

<p>When the farms were offered for sale there
were from ten to fourteen applicants for each of
the improved farms. Four of the unimproved
farms were not applied for and these will be
seeded and offered to settlers later at the opening
of the next tract. Every one of the farm laborers'
allotments was applied for. The settlement was
made self-sustaining and productive within sixty
days from the date the land was purchased.</p>

<p>As to the racial composition of this colony and
the way in which the method of colonization
would affect the incorporation of the different
racial elements in the life of the settlement, the
superintendent, Mr. George C. Kreutzer, made
the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Five of the settlers on the colony are of German origin,
two of Danish origin, two Italian, one French, and all the
others are of either English, Irish, or Scotch origin.</p>

<p>No policy of mixing nationalities was followed. These farmers
put in either a first, second, or third choice for the allotments
they desired, and the board then selected the man best
suited agriculturally for the particular block he was allotted.</p>

<p>Under our system of allotting blocks here the farmers are
particularly concerned in making a success of their farms
financially, rather than socially. We were never confronted
with the problem of having too many of one nationality in
the community, and as we have only fifty-three farms to
offer for settlers, it is not large enough to involve the problem
at all. Further than this, I do not think the problem
will come up under this system of allotting blocks, for the
reason first stated above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
It will Americanize immigrants through co-operation and
social intercourse, through the various settlers' organizations
necessary to their social and financial welfare. We
have a Stock Breeders' Association which meets at regular
times to discuss live-stock problems at intervals during the
year. They are all on equal terms, each one buying the
land for himself, thus breaking down class distinction.
There will not be the distinction between lessees and freeholders
that we find in the Middle States. Their children
will go to the same school.</p></div>

<p>This undertaking of California is the only one
in the field of public land colonization anywhere
in the country, except for projects involving
soldier settlements which some states have lately
begun to undertake.</p>

<h3>STATE PROVISION FOR SOLDIER SETTLEMENTS</h3>

<p>With the close of the War there began to appear
on the calendars of state legislatures the subject
of land settlement provision for returning soldiers.
Up to the time this report was written,
twenty-three states had passed some legislation
relative to this need. The following table indicates
in a general way the extent and nature of
this provision.</p>

In more than half the states the laws refer to
Federal legislation, in a few cases specifying that
the appropriation shall be contingent upon a
national appropriation. Several states signify
their approval of co-operation with Federal provision,
but make no appropriation for the work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
The largest appropriation in the form of a bond
issue for popular approval of $10,000,000 was
passed by the California legislature. Similar
provision was made by Missouri, South Dakota,
and Utah to the amount of $1,000,000. Nevada
arranged for the borrowing of $1,000,000 for
"reclamation, improvement, and equipment of
lands ... for soldiers, sailors, marines, and other
loyal citizens." Washington appropriated a
revolving fund beginning with $1,050,000 and
eventually reaching $3,000,000 to create a state
Reclamation Service.</p>

<p>In spite of this evidence of awakened interest
in soldier settlements, many such projects have
died before any real attempt could be made to
put them into practical operation. This is to be
explained as follows. The projects in a number
of cases were products rather of sentiment than
of logic based upon experience. War-time patriotism
created a desire to give some sort of
reward to men fighting for the country's cause.
"Let us give to each returning soldier a farm&mdash;a
ready-made farm!" was heard throughout the
country. Whether we had enough land, or economically
available land, for millions of farms
was not always asked. Many of the project-makers
turned to our swamps, deserts, and cut-over
lands filled with stumps and debris.</p>

<p>The easy-flowing imagination of these people,
especially of the city type, made out of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
lands new farms, flourishing gardens, meadows
and fields burdened with crops waving in the
winds. How much it would cost, whence would
come the money and energy to create such a
miracle, and how much time the prosecution of
the plan would require was not asked. Would
not our returned soldiers, who already are
matured men, be in their graves before their
desert and swamp farms gave a living to their
cultivators? Still more strange was the common
notion that all soldiers, even the crippled, were
eager to settle on land&mdash;that all wanted land and
all were fit to be farmers!</p>

<p>As the product of mere fancy, such sweeping
soldiers' settlement projects were bound to die
a natural death. And yet they have not been
without value. They created lively discussion,
and called attention to our land problems, especially
to the reclamation and colonization of unused
lands by the people who want land and are
fit to be farmers and to do hard land-pioneering
work, be they returned soldiers, native farmers,
or newly arrived immigrants.</p>

<h3>THE RECLAMATION ACT</h3>

<p>The Federal Reclamation Service was established
by an act of June 17, 1902, ch. 1093, 32 Stat., 388.
<a name="FNanchor_E_4" id="FNanchor_E_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_4" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
This act provides that the moneys received from
the sale of public lands in the Western states,
with the exception of the 5 per centum reserved
by law for educational and other purposes, shall
be set aside in the Treasury as a <i>reclamation
fund</i> to be used for the construction and maintenance
of irrigation works for the purpose of reclaiming
arid and semiarid lands in these states.</p>

<p>Authority to conduct the reclamation work is
placed in the hands of the Secretary of the Interior.
He is given authority to withdraw from
public entry the lands required for irrigation
works and to restore the withdrawn lands to
public entry when their use for such purpose is
over. Under the authority conferred upon him
by the act (Section 4, and Opinion Assistant
Attorney General, April 16, 1906, 34 L. D., 567)
he may enter into contracts for the construction
of irrigation works or construct such works by
labor employed and operated under the superintendence
and direction of government officials.</p>

<p>The Secretary is authorized to give public
notice of the lands irrigable under such project,
and limit of area per entry, which limit shall
represent the acreage which, in the opinion of
the Secretary, may be reasonably required for
the support of a family upon the reclaimed
lands; and of the charges which shall be made
per acre upon the entries, and upon lands in
private ownership which may be irrigated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
waters of the irrigation works. The charges shall
be determined with a view to returning to the
reclamation fund the cost of construction and
shall be apportioned equitably.</p>

<p>It is provided that in all construction work
eight hours shall constitute a day's work and no
Mongolian labor shall be employed (32 Stat., 389).
No right to the use of water for land in private
ownership shall be sold for a tract exceeding 160
acres to any one landowner. It is provided that
the reclamation fund shall be used for the operation
and maintenance of irrigation works and
that when the payments required by the act are
made for the major portion of the lands irrigated
the management of these works shall pass to the
landowners.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to
acquire any rights or property for reclamation
purposes by purchase or by condemnation under
judicial process, and to pay from the reclamation
fund sums needed for that purpose. Within
thirty days, upon application of the Secretary of
the Interior, the Attorney General of the United
States shall institute condemnation proceedings.
The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to
make rules and regulations for carrying the provisions
of the act into full force and effect.</p>

<p>In the seventeen years since the passage of the
Reclamation Act the surveys, examinations, and
construction authorized by it have proceeded, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
to-day, according to the report of the Secretary
of the Interior for 1919,
<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>the service is in a position to deliver water to about 1,600,000
acres of irrigable land, covered by crop census, of which
about 1,120,000 acres are now being irrigated. Besides this
storage water is delivered from permanent reservoirs under
special contracts to about 950,000 acres more. The projects
that have been undertaken have been planned to provide
for an area of about 3,200,000 acres.</p></div>

<p>A number of bills have been proposed for enlarging
and extending this work.</p>

<h3>PROPOSED FEDERAL LEGISLATION</h3>

<p>The Department of the Interior has prepared
a draft of a bill providing rural homes for returning
soldiers. Copies of the bill were sent to the
Governors for consideration by various state
legislatures.</p>

<p>The bill is based on the principle of co-operation,
according to which (1) the state provides
land, acquiring it by purchase or by agreement
with the present landowners whereby the latter
turn their holdings over to the state for a reasonable
price gradually paid to them out of the
returns from the settlers, and (2) the Federal
government advances money for reclamation
through irrigation, drainage, and clearing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
for preparation of the land for immediate farming
through the providing of buildings, implements,
seeds, live stock, etc. The total cost of the land
and improvements, with interest at 4 per cent on
capital invested, will be repaid by the settlers
during the course of, approximately, forty years
by an annual payment of 5 per cent of the total
cost.</p>

<p>A bill was introduced in Congress by Senator
Myers (S. 4947, 65th Congress, 2d Session) in
October, 1918, and backed by the Department
of the Interior, which provided for a survey and
classification by this department of all unentered
public lands and all privately owned unused lands
for the purpose of finding out what lands can be
reclaimed and put to productive use by returning
soldiers who would like to settle on land and engage
in agriculture. After such an investigation
the Secretary of the Interior was required to
report to Congress and to propose a plan for the
settlement and cultivation of such lands.</p>

<p>There were two bills (S. 5397 and H. 15672)
introduced by Senator W. S. Kenyon of Iowa
and Representative M. Clyde Kelly of Pennsylvania,
respectively, which, among other features,
made possible development of rural districts.
Although differing in details, the bills both appropriated
$100,000,000 to be expended in providing
employment primarily for returning soldiers.
This was to be done through the authorized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
public construction work, or through the organization
and extension of useful public works, in
the development of natural resources. Only in
localities where the Secretary of Labor reports
extraordinary unemployment to exist shall public
works be carried on from this fund.</p>

<p>The House bill provided for the building of
new post roads; for the transfer of war material
no longer needed by the army, the same to be
used for the construction, improvement, and
maintenance of the post roads; for supplementing
the public school equipment where public
school buildings are or shall be designated as
postal stations, for the use of the construction
service; and for other purposes. The bill provides
for the establishment of motor transport
and postal routes; for the organization of a
system of marketing facilities for the collection
and delivery, through the postal service and
public school buildings, of farm products from
producer to consumer; and for the construction
of any authorized public work.</p>

<p>In addition to these more indirect ways of
opening up the country the bill carried specific
provision for promoting and conducting land-settlement
colonies, as well as provision for logging
or milling operations, contingent upon a
continuous yield of timber, so that the forest
communities would be permanent. The provisions
of the bill were to be carried out by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
interdepartmental National Board of Public
Construction, which would organize a body of
workers, known as the United States Construction
Service.</p>

<p>Since the bill carried the reclamation and
technical land-improvement work, the only question
might be, is there any need for this to
be carried on by a special Construction Service?
Would it not be a duplication of the work of the
already existing Reclamation Service of the
Department of the Interior? Would it not be
economical and otherwise proper to increase the
staff and other working forces of the Reclamation
Service to the extent of the proposed reclamation
duties of the Construction Service?</p>

<p>Representative E. T. Taylor of Colorado introduced
in the House, February 15, 1919, a bill
(H. R. 15993) providing for employment and the
securing of rural homes for returned soldiers and
for the promotion of the reclamation of land for
cultivation under the direction of the Secretary
of the Interior. Short-term loans to settlers were
provided for. This bill contains a good land-development
plan, except that the Reclamation
Service, Department of the Interior, ought not
to be burdened with colonization work and with
loans to settlers. Colonization work ought to
be the duty of a separate body, and the extension
of credit to settlers naturally belongs to the Farm
Loan Board, Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Representative Mondell of Wyoming introduced
in the House, May 19, 1919, a bill (H. R.
487) providing employment and rural homes for
returned soldiers through the reclamation of
lands under the direction of the Secretary of the
Interior, who may, for this purpose, acquire by
gift, purchase, deed in trust, or otherwise, the
necessary lands for soldier settlement projects
and, for the same purpose, may withdraw, utilize,
and dispose of by contract and deed suitable public
lands. An appropriation of $500,000 is proposed.</p>

<p>The plan in this bill for the acquisition and
reclamation of unused land is a strong one.
Equally commendable is the provision for safeguarding
the settlers' holdings against speculation,
for the selling, leasing, or mortgaging of the
land by settlers requires the approval of the
Secretary of the Interior. The bill requires
that the Interior Department, through its
Reclamation Service, acquire and improve lands,
colonize them, and make loans to settlers. It
would seem a more efficient plan to make a
division of these various duties. The Reclamation
Service should acquire and improve lands
for settlement, while the colonization work and
the extension of loans to settlers would be made
the duties of other public authorities, as pointed
out below.</p>

<p>House Bill No. 3274, introduced by Representative
Knutson, May 27, 1919, proposes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
create, in the Treasury Department, a National
Colonization Board with local colonization commissions,
for the purpose of providing capital
for the development by land colonization of the
agricultural resources of the nation, affording
certain privileges to soldier settlers. The commissions
approve and charter private colonization
companies and recommend applications for
loans after seeing all the provisions of the act
have been complied with. The commissions are
to include the directors of the district land bank.</p>

<p>The main aim of the bill is to standardize private
land colonization companies to a certain
degree, to facilitate the extension of credit to
them, and to make loans to soldier settlers. The
Knutson bill in meeting these needs is a comprehensive
one. It deserves the closest attention
of Congress. Would it not be advisable, however,
to attach the administrative machinery for
credit extension outlined in the bill to a division
to be created in the Farm Loan Board, with
separate colonization credit funds, and to leave
the regulation and licensing of the private colonization
companies to a separate body as outlined
below?</p>

<p>Senator Thomas J. Walsh of Montana introduced
in the Senate, August 20, 1917, a bill
(S. 2812) which was passed by both Houses and
reported from conference for passage in February,
1919. The bill provides for the sale or lease of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
coal, oil, and other mineral lands on the public
domain. The leasing clause of the bill is weakened
by the provision, "unless previously
entered under Section 2 of this act." The
public coal lands would be "entered," sold into
private ownership, which means the loss of public
control over these lands and the methods of
their exploitation. However, the bill if passed
would be a step forward in the sense that it would
increase opportunities for investment of capital
and employment of labor, which would result in
the increase of the coal output so much needed.</p>

<p>The only step so far undertaken by Congress
in the direction of land colonization is the appropriation
of $200,000 for an investigation by the
Reclamation Service, Department of the Interior,
of lands outside of the existing reclamation
projects. The measures needed are waiting for
action.</p>

<p>In regard to the available land for acquisition,
reclamation, and colonization, several projects
are proposed by the above-quoted bills and by
various Federal departments. The principal
projects are as follows:</p>

<div>
<ol class="decimal">
  <li>Agricultural:
      <ol class="lower-alpha">
        <li>Logged-off lands in the North Middle Western<br />
            and Northwestern states.</li>
        <li>Irrigation of desert lands in the Southwestern<br />
            states.</li>
        <li>Drainage of swamp lands in the Southern states.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Forestry projects; permanent colonies for logging,
                                       <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><br />
      milling, and reforestation of logged-off lands in the<br />
      Northwestern states.</li>
  <li>Colonization projects for an intensive cultivation of<br />
      lands around smaller growing towns.</li>
  <li>Colonization projects in Alaska for developing various<br />
      extractive industries.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Action of some sort is eminently desirable in this
country, especially in view of the fact that other
countries have already taken steps to these ends.</p>

<h3>PROVISION IN OTHER COUNTRIES</h3>

<p>The settlement of soldiers on land has been a
problem much considered in all of the warring
nations. Although the plans are just only being
tried out for the first time in many cases, they
are suggestive of the trend that land-settlement
laws are taking.</p>

<p>In 1918 a law was enacted in France "providing
for the acquisition of small rural properties by
soldier and civilian victims of the war. It provides
in part for 'individual mortgage loans to
facilitate acquisition, parceling out, transformation,
and reconstitution of small rural properties
of which the value does not exceed 10,000 francs.'
The loans are to be made from the agricultural
lending societies at a rate of 1 per cent, with a
term of twenty-five years. Advances for improvements
are provided for and a special commission
is appointed to administer the law."
<a name="FNanchor_E_6" id="FNanchor_E_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_6" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
In the United Kingdom, as well as in the majority
of its dominions and states, acts providing
for land settlement for ex-soldiers have been
passed or formulated. Large sums of money
have already been appropriated for the purchase,
improvement, and development of land. In some
cases the crown lands are to be used and in
other private lands are to be bought. Table
III indicates some of the general provisions of
the legislation.</p>

<p>Over $133,000,000 has been appropriated and in
two Australian states alone 2,060,000 acres have
been set aside. The size of the individual holdings
varies from 10 to 160 acres.</p>

<p>In some cases the land is given outright, in
others the settler must help bear the cost of
surveys and improvement. The third plan is
that of a lease, usually with an option to buy,
varying in different states. Whatever the terms
of settlement are, in most cases the ex-soldier
can meet his obligations because of the easy
terms by which he can borrow money from the
government. Although the maximum amount is
limited, the rate of interest is low in most cases
and the term of years, with one exception, twenty
years or more. Although some farming experience
is required, in almost every law, there is
provision for a demonstration farm. Here the
prospective farmers can learn scientific farming,
usually getting paid for their work in the interval.</p>

<h2>VII<br />
A LAND POLICY</h2>

<p>Most of the land-reform programs, beginning
with those of the extreme conservatives, <i>laissez-faire</i>
theorists of various schools, and ending
with those of the extreme radicals, anarchists,
and socialists of various leanings, are primarily
concerned with the question of land ownership.</p>

<h3>WIDE RANGE IN PROGRAMS</h3>

<p>These programs might be, in the main, classified
as follows:</p>

<div>
<ol class="upper-roman">
    <li>Private land ownership:
        <ol class="upper-alpha">
            <li>Large-scale ownership, subject to no public interference.</li>
            <li>Small-scale ownership, limited and regulated by<br />
                public authority.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Public land ownership:
        <ol class="upper-alpha">
            <li>Secured by
                <ol class="decimal">
                    <li>Confiscation, by revolutionary action.</li>
                    <li>Purchase, by land bond issues.</li>
                    <li>Taxation, by the single tax.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Forms of public ownership:
                <ol class="decimal">
                    <li>Nationalization; national ownership. In the<br />
                        United States it would be Federal ownership.</li>
                    <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
                        Provincial ownership. In the United States<br />
                        it would be state ownership, and in Switzerland<br />
                        canton ownership.</li>
                    <li>Municipalization or communalization; land<br />
                        owned by cities and communities in the rural<br />
                        districts.</li>
                    <li>Nobody's ownership; free to all, except that<br />
                        the public takes the ground value (irrespective<br />
                        of improvements) through the single tax,<br />
                        from the land users, which practically means<br />
                        a disguised form of public ownership, or at<br />
                        least a condition very near it.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Methods of use:
                <ol class="decimal">
                    <li>Parceling the public land into homesteads of<br />
                        one-family size, and reselling these to the cultivators<br />
                        on the basis of individual fee simple.</li>
                    <li>Giving the homesteads to cultivators on the<br />
                        basis of perpetual leasehold.</li>
                    <li>Public cultivation, either direct or through<br />
                        communes or co-operative associations.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Comparing these programs one with another
and with the existing conditions, one reaches the
following conclusions: All the programs tend to
treat the land problem merely as a question of
ownership. Each favors a specific form of ownership
almost as an all-inclusive remedy for defects
in social relations so far as they depend upon land
cultivation and land use. The argument is based
upon reasoning, a mere logical calculation, and
on what the authors of the program desire. The
existing conditions and tendencies are much
more varied and complex than they seem to
appear to the land reformers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
First, there is nothing new or untried in these
programs, for almost all the advocated forms of
land ownership are already existing side by side.
It seems that no one single form is able to remedy
the defects in the land situation. We have
in this country national (Federal), provincial
(state), and municipal or communal ownership,
with small-scale private ownership predominating.
We also have special land taxation, as, for
instance, in certain cities that tax unimproved
land higher than improved land. These existing
forms of land ownership are competing with one
another. The forms which allow more efficient
cultivation, result in greater social stability, and
are based on social justice will be the winners in
the march of the economic and social progress of
the country.</p>

<p>The bold claim of Marxian or German Socialism
that large private land ownership, erroneously
identified with cultivation on a large scale,
is going to prevail through absorption of small
private land ownership is rapidly losing ground.
The small landowners are able to enjoy, through
co-operation, all the technical advantages of large-scale
cultivation, retaining as well the advantages
resulting from individual initiative and
efficiency. There is a marked movement toward
co-operation among the small farmers the world
over. In Denmark it has developed to the
highest degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Second, mere land ownership is only a part,
though a vital part, of the problem. Many other
important things have to be considered.</p>

<p>If a man has land, but lacks capital or credit,
he is unable to make economic use of his land.
If he has both land and capital, or credit, or in
other terms purchasing power, but lacks access
to sources of supply in which to buy seeds, breeding
stock, and implements, he still is unable to
make use of his land. If he has at hand all the
needed implements, seeds, and stock, but lacks
knowledge and experience in farming, he might
entirely fail in his enterprise. Even if he possesses
the necessary knowledge and produces
grain, milk, beef, and other agricultural products,
he must have a market for his products, be it
a domestic or an international market. This
involves transportation facilities, trade organization
and regulation, tariff, and other forms of
organized international relationships, economic
and political.</p>

<p>Moreover, land cultivation requires social stability,
security, and order, for an investment in
land improvements must wait long for its returns.
If a man does not know who is going to harvest
his fields, or who is going to get the product of
his toil, he will be disinclined to sow anything.
A striking illustration of such a state is the case
of the western provinces of the Russian Empire,
where the battle lines for several years were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
surging back and forth. First the Russian monarchy
collected the farm products, then came the
Germans, then came the civil warfare. When
there is no security for a land cultivator, neither
for his products nor his very life itself, there
can be no production. There is land enough
and there are cultivators enough, but the population
starves because of unsettled political and
international conditions.</p>

<h3>PLENTY OF LAND</h3>

<p>In considering the land situation as it exists, it
is true that the ownership of land or, rather, the
access to land, is of primary importance. The
question arises, Is there enough land in the
United States for all citizens who desire to become
cultivators?</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Lane, states
<a name="FNanchor_F_1" id="FNanchor_F_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_1" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
that more than 15,000,000 acres of irrigable lands
remain in the hands of the United States government.
There are between 70,000,000 and 80,000,000
acres of swamp and overflowed lands in
the United States of which about 60,000,000
acres can be reclaimed for agricultural purposes,
and there are about 200,000,000 acres of cut-over
or logged-off lands which are suitable for
agricultural development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Although it might be questioned how much of
these unused lands are economically available
under normal conditions&mdash;for no rigid investigation
has been made&mdash;still the fact remains that
unused lands&mdash;swamps and deserts, cut-over and
burned-over lands&mdash;are being continually improved
and taken under cultivation by private
and public effort. Not one land improvement
and colonization company visited by the writer
complained of lack of land. All the companies
seemed to want more settlers and more credit.
This fact indicates that there is economically
available land in our country, and probably
plenty of it, for a normal process of reclamation
and colonization.</p>

<h3>PUBLIC REGULATION OF LAND DEALING</h3>

<p>In the field investigation, the main questions of
immigrants desiring to settle on land seemed to
be where to find land of the "right kind," and
how, in acquiring it, to avoid being cheated by
private land sellers. The questions as to whether
there was land available and what its price was
were of minor importance. In many cases the
immigrants had been employed in war industries
and had saved money enough to buy a farm, but
they were unable to decide where to settle and
what kind of land to buy because they feared
land sellers. Their experience with these agents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
had awakened an almost universal fear of private
land dealers.</p>

<p>To facilitate the access to land, the private
land-dealing trade must be put upon a higher
level. There must be Federal legislation regulating
land dealers doing business in two or more
states, state legislation for dealers doing business
within one state only, and municipal legislation
for the land dealers doing business within the
city limits only. Through co-operation of these
governments uniformity of such legislation can
be secured and maintained so far as various local
conditions and peculiarities allow.</p>

<p>Such regulative legislation should aim at doing
away with misrepresentation and frauds in land
dealing. As an effective assistance in the enforcement
of the laws all private land dealers
should be licensed, interstate dealers by the
Federal, state dealers by the state, and city
dealers by the city governments. By refusing or
recalling licenses a considerable number of land
sharks&mdash;get-rich-quick charlatans in the real-estate
business&mdash;can be sifted out of the trade
and the necessary confidence on the part of land
seekers can be secured.</p>

<p>According to a report made in 1916 by the
Committee on State Legislation of the National
Association of Real Estate Boards, a sentiment
was then growing in most parts of the country
favoring the enactment of laws for the regulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of real-estate brokerages under state authority.
This sentiment is still growing, and the secretary
of the association says that realtors in several
states continue to introduce bills in their legislatures
with the belief that it will be possible to
pass them.</p>

<p>In only one state has such a law passed. The
state of Wisconsin enacted a law in 1919
<a name="FNanchor_F_2" id="FNanchor_F_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_2" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> which
provides for the establishment of a state real-estate
brokers' board consisting of three members,
at least two of whom are real-estate brokers
in the state, appointed by the Governor. The
Director of Immigration, Department of Agriculture,
acts as secretary to the board. The
latter issues licenses to the real-estate brokers
and salesmen doing business in the state. An
annual license fee of ten dollars from a broker
and five dollars from a salesman is required.
License may be refused or revoked by the board
for misstatement in application, for fraud or
fraudulent practices, for untrustworthiness or incompetence
in real-estate business.</p>

<p>The board receives complaints against any
real-estate broker or salesman. It may conduct
hearings and investigations, subp&oelig;na and compel
the attendance and testimony of witnesses
and production of documents, books and papers.
The board shall, from time to time, publish the
names of licensed real-estate brokers and salesmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
with information as to when each license
expires. The publication shall include the names
of those real-estate brokers and salesmen whose
licenses have been revoked at any time within one
year prior to the time of the issue of publication.</p>

<p>This Wisconsin Real Estate Licensing law has
been in operation a year. Mr. B. G. Packer,
Director of Immigration, and secretary to the
Real Estate Brokers' Board, gave to the writer
the following information in regard to the results
of the operation of the law so far.</p>

<p>This law requires registration of all real-estate
brokers and salesmen doing business in the state.
In the past there was no way to tell who they
were or where located. The license is good for
one year, and thereupon a new application must
be made. This gives the board a check on the
dealer's operations the preceding year. The
board requires him to cite all legal actions arising
out of his real-estate business whether he
was plaintiff or defendant.</p>

<p>It is a common practice with some dealers to
take a judgment note for commission which can
be entered up without process and execution
levied against the property of the defendants.
The defendant can open up the judgment and
put in a defense if he can show misrepresentation
and fraud. This year, when several applicants
applied for new licenses, the board found this
condition and the licenses were refused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
The applicant for license must show affirmatively
that he is trustworthy and competent.
In the past the state took no pains to find this
out. The licensing board operates as a poor
man's court of redress in transactions arising
out of the land business. In the past the purchaser's
remedy was a more or less satisfactory
suit at law.</p>

<p>The licensing board can make investigations
and hold hearings on its own motion. In the
past the initiative had to be taken by the party
claiming deception.</p>

<p>Last year the board granted licenses to 4,600
brokers and salesmen, denied 20 applications, revoked
2 licenses, and has at present 60 hearings
pending on applications for licenses in 1921.</p>

<p>The Wisconsin license law does not reach the
owner who has worthless land to unload upon
an unsophisticated purchaser. Besides this, the
law has other limitations. But nevertheless it is
a step ahead.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, the Southern states, and cities
in many parts of the country have required a
license fee or an occupation tax from real-estate
men, but such laws do not regulate, because, as
the above-mentioned report states, "no matter
how high the fee, the usual run of licensing or
prosecuting official will not use his authority to
establish moral standards." Furthermore, "in
New York and most Northern and Western states,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
even the slight check of the occupation tax is
absent and there is no formality to be observed
in entering our profession by any person, no
matter how unreliable, irresponsible, or incapable,
and whatever his record."</p>

<p>After agitation covering a period of twelve
years, the real-estate brokers of California
succeeded in 1917 in having enacted a law
for the regulation of real-estate brokerage.
In 1918 this law was declared unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court, on the ground that insurance
men were exempted by the wording of
the act and that such exemption made the law
discriminatory.</p>

<p>The Real Estate Commissioner of the state
gives the following synopsis of the law:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The act "provides for the issuance of licenses to two
classes of persons&mdash;the broker himself, who, in addition to
taking out a license, is required to put up a bond running to
the state of California, and the salesman, who is defined as
one in the employ of a licensed broker and ... is not required
to put up a bond." The act is administered by a Real Estate
Commissioner appointed by the Governor. Upon petition to
the Real Estate Commissioner appointed by those aggrieved
in their dealings with brokers or salesmen, a hearing is provided
before the commissioner, and upon proper showing
the petitioner may be granted the privilege of suing the
broker on his bond.... There is also a provision for the filing
of complaints against brokers and salesmen concerning their
conduct and, upon investigation, if found guilty, the commissioner
is empowered to revoke their licenses. The law
provides a heavy penalty for a broker&mdash;a fine of $2,000 or a
prison sentence of two years&mdash;and in the case of corporations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
a maximum fine of $5,000. The fees for licenses
are, for brokers, $10 per annum, and for salesmen, $2
per annum.</p></div>

<p>The operation of the law appears to have been
extremely successful and to have been heartily
indorsed by the public generally and by all the
reliable real-estate dealers and salesmen in the
state. The Real Estate Commissioner gives the
following picture of the results of the law during
the eight months it was in force:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. It gave the realtors faith in each other, each being
under bond and licensed by the commissioner with power of
revocation in case of violation of the law.</p>

<p>2. It increased the confidence of the public generally in
the realty business, for the law afforded the public a ready
and inexpensive means of redress in case of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>3. During the eight months, some sixty complaints were
filed with the commissioner, and all were adjusted without
even a formal hearing up to the time the law was thrown
out, March, 1918. Some twenty-five hundred dollars was
returned to defrauded purchasers through appeals to the
commissioner.</p>

<p>4. The deterrent effect of the law on wrongdoers will
never be known, but must have been far-reaching.</p>

<p>5. So satisfactory was the law that the public, the bankers,
and especially the realtors, are preparing again to present to
the legislature during the winter of 1918&ndash;19 a more carefully
worded law governing the realty business.</p></div>

<p>One of the services rendered by the Department
of the Real Estate Commissioner was the
issue of a directory of licensed real-estate brokers
and salesmen in the state. The first copy was
published October 1, 1917, and contained about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
four thousand names, as well as other material
such as maps, laws, and legal opinions, designed
to be of practical value to all realtors. It was
intended that this directory be issued quarterly
and be distributed to licensed brokers, with a
subscription price to others of one dollar a
year. The commissioner regarded this directory
bulletin which bound together in fraternalism
the real-estate men of the state, as only
one of the many possibilities of extending valuable
aids through his department to the real-estate
profession, and so indirectly to the agricultural
industry.</p>

<p>Although there have been attempts in other
states to secure legislation, so far they have been
unsuccessful. In essentials they have resembled
the California law, although differing in details,
such as amounts of bonds, fees, and penalties.
In Minnesota, several years ago, the State Immigration
Commission was instrumental in introducing
a land-regulation bill which was killed by
the efforts of the land dealers.</p>

<p>In 1914 the Executive Committee of the Real
Estate Association of New York submitted for
the consideration of the association a bill for the
licensing of real-estate brokers and the creation
of a real-estate commission. In 1916 a bill similar
to this one was introduced in the legislature of
the state of New York, but failed of passage. In
Texas a bill was approved by the Texas Realty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Association, but was not enacted into law. In
addition to efforts for legislation in the states
there have been national recommendations.</p>

<p>The Committee on State Legislation of the
National Association of Real Estate Exchanges
in 1913 reported on a bill for the regulation of the
real-estate business. The main provisions are as
follows:</p>

<p>A State Board on Real Estate Licenses shall
be established, consisting of five members, all
real-estate men, appointed by the Governor, and
having its headquarters in the state capitol.
Every person engaged in the real-estate business
shall apply for a license to the board. The applicant
shall present proof that his standing is
above reproach and that his record for honesty
and fair dealing is clear. The applicant shall file
a satisfactory bond in the amount of $1,000,
conditioned on the faithful performance of any
undertaking as a real-estate broker, the bond to
be renewed with each renewal of the annual
license. The fee for the license shall be $10 for
each dealer, firm, or corporation, and $2.50 for
each salesman, the fees to be, respectively, $5
and $1 after the first year. Licenses shall expire
each year. The board shall have power to revoke
at any time any license where the holder
thereof is guilty of gross misrepresentation in
making sales, etc., or of any other conduct which,
in the opinion of the board, is opposed to good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
business morals. The board shall investigate all
complaints; it shall have power to subp&oelig;na witnesses.
Any person violating the act shall be
fined not less than the compensation or profit
received or agreed to, and not more than four
times that amount, or be imprisoned not more
than thirty days, or both.</p>

<p>The Legislative Committee of the Interstate
Realty Association of the Pacific Northwest has
proposed a real-estate license law for the state
of Washington, the main provisions of which are
similar to the others already quoted.</p>

<p>Although there has been no successful state-wide
provision, in Portland, Oregon, an ordinance
licensing real-estate brokers was approved in
1912, including the salient features of the proposed
state laws. Application is made to the
city auditors, with proof of the applicant's
good standing and square dealing. The Council
Committee on licenses has power to revoke
or withhold, and penalties are provided
for.</p>

<p>As an example of the occupational tax law
applying to the real-estate business, the law of
the District of Columbia may be mentioned.
The District of Columbia (1914) has a law imposing
a license tax of $50 per annum on real-estate
brokers or agents. The assessor of the
District said that the fee was not large enough
to restrict character of trade, and that the payment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of the fee was the only qualification for a
license.</p>

<h3>A PUBLIC LAND EXCHANGE</h3>

<p>In addition to the need for honest dealing there
is everywhere felt the need of bringing farm
sellers and buyers together through a public
agency. Certain states, in co-operation with the
Federal Department of Agriculture, have made
provision for doing this. For this purpose an
office is created similar to a public employment
office. It aims to provide the farm sellers and
buyers with more or less reliable information
without cost to either side.</p>

<p>In the state of Maryland the Extension Service
of the state college, in co-operation with the
Federal Department of Agriculture, has worked
out a farm-description blank for farm sellers.
The blank contains questions in regard to the
location of the farm, its size, distance from communication
lines, and inhabited places of various
sizes and market facilities, its soil, its fences,
buildings, water supply, ownership, price, and
other points intended to show the condition and
value of the farm for sale. The office distributes
these blanks among the county agents, from
whom the farm sellers secure the blanks. The
county agents forward the completed forms to
the main state office, which periodically publishes
the collected information for farm buyers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
This information is available to farm buyers
for the mere asking. Anyone can see, in the
state office or in the published volume, the blanks
describing in detail the farms for sale. In this
way they can be directly connected with the
seller of the selected farm, without agents or
advertising cost to either side. Thus misrepresentation
can be avoided to a certain degree.
The Extension Service, however, does not enter
into any financial arrangement or give any
guaranties. Aside from the information contained
in the filled forms, it gives information
of a general character concerning the agricultural
possibilities of the state and of various sections
and localities in it. At present the Service is
particularly interested in locating the returned
soldiers.</p>

<p>As such a public agency system is of comparatively
recent origin and has not had time to develop,
it is impossible to judge with certainty its
future possibilities. In theory the operation of
the system seems to be an easy matter, but in
practice it is complicated. The farmers who intend
to sell their holdings have to be informed of
the work of the office, and equally the farm
buyers have to be acquainted with the plan.
This involves education of the farmers by an
extensive advertising campaign, which requires
time and expenditure of public money. However,
there is a real need for such a public agency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and the results of the attempts to establish and
develop it have been encouraging.</p>

<p>It would be desirable that the states which
have already established or will establish such
public agencies should co-operate with one another
through the Federal Department of Agriculture
and, with the assistance of the latter,
should organize a central office as a clearing
house. Nation-wide advertisement should be
made by the central office for all the states in
co-operation. In this way the farm advertisements
would be made more effective&mdash;unnecessary
repetitions, and the expenses connected
with these, would be avoided. Through interchange
of experiences a uniform system might be
established. Such a central office, in co-operation
with the Immigration Bureau, Department
of Labor, should inform immigrants who desire
to establish rural homes of the various farm
opportunities.</p>

<h3>RECLAMATION A SEPARATE FUNCTION</h3>

<p>Up to this time both public and private efforts
have been applied to the reclaiming of unused
lands, rendering valuable service to the progress
of the country. There ought, however, to be no
question whether reclamation work should be a
public or a private enterprise. If a number, and
even a large number, of the private land-development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
companies have hitherto mined in the
pockets of their land buyers instead of in the
land itself, this has been largely because of the
lack of any public regulation of private land-improvement
companies. However, a number,
perhaps a majority, of the companies have improved
their land and have secured settlers who
have made a success in the cultivation of the
improved land. Therefore it would be a grave
mistake to abandon or even to repress private
enterprise in land-development work. It should
be encouraged by the extension of public credit
through the land companies and by putting their
business under public supervision.</p>

<p>Where considerable areas have to be reclaimed,
involving large expenditures and a long period
of waiting for returns, public reclamation is
preferable.</p>

<p>Although reclamation and colonization work
are closely connected and dependent upon
each other, still there is a marked difference.
It is one thing to plan and irrigate a desert area
and quite a different thing successfully to populate
the irrigated land. The first is mainly a
technical enterprise, while the other deals mainly
with human beings. The people who direct and
prosecute reclamation works&mdash;civil engineers and
other technical experts&mdash;might not be good
colonizers. The duties of the latter consist in
selecting suitable settlers, directing their land-cultivation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
work, and organizing and directing
the community life of the settlers. On the other
hand, colonizers, trained agriculturists, and community
workers might not be able successfully
to conduct reclamation works. Therefore these
two fields ought to be recognized as distinct and
provided for separately.</p>

<p>Almost all the proposed plans of land settlement
fail to make such a distinction. They propose
that the same public agency should acquire
land, improve it, and colonize it. The same is
true in regard to most of the private land-improvement
and colonization projects. They plan
to improve land and at the same time colonize it,
which too often consists merely in securing land
buyers and leaving the latter, after they have
made their initial payment, entirely to their
own fate.</p>

<p>Private land-improvement companies doing
business in two or more states should be brought
under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reclamation
Service. They should be licensed, their projects
approved, and their general methods of
business regulated. Private companies doing
business within state or city limits should be regulated
by state irrigation or drainage district
authorities, with whom the Federal Reclamation
Service should co-operate in every possible
way.</p>

<p>In order that the Federal Reclamation Service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
may be extended and expanded to meet the growing
demands, further legislation must be passed
by Congress. Liberal appropriations are needed
both for the acquisition and reclamation of unused
lands of different classes, as well as for the
increase of the staff and working forces of the
Service. The bills under consideration were
discussed in Chapter VI. The bill introduced
by Representative Mondell of Wyoming effectively
provides for this service.</p>

<h3>A COLONIZATION BOARD</h3>

<p>The word "colonization" suggests the following:
populating a given unused area of land suitable
for cultivation, according to a plan covering the
selection of people, the cultivation of the land,
providing credit and markets, instruction in land
cultivation, planning, organizing, and directing of
community life in its numerous branches, such as
co-operation for various purposes, education,
recreation. Colonization work in the modern
sense is a new, delicate, and complex field, for it
affects all sides of human life.</p>

<p>There is a wide difference of opinion the country
over as to whether colonization should be a
public affair or be left to private initiative and
effort. Those who favor private colonization
claim that public colonization is wasteful, uneconomical,
that it puts a new burden on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
taxpayers, and savors of Socialism. Those who
favor public colonization maintain that private
colonization companies in the very nature of
their endeavors work for their own profit, considering
the settlers' interests and public welfare
of secondary importance. Colonization results
must not be counted only in the terms of money,
but also in the terms of social value to the community
and to the country.</p>

<p>Again the writer has to call attention to the
fact that both public and private colonization is
going on side by side all over the world. In certain
foreign countries public colonization is predominant,
while in this country the reverse is
true. Only the state of California has undertaken
public colonization as an experiment on a
small scale, and so far with success.</p>

<p>It would be advisable that both public and
private colonization go on, one competing with
the other and learning from the other's experience.
Private companies must be regulated and
licensed by public authorities, and public credit
should be extended to them. All this requires
that the colonization work be organized on a
nation-wide scale.</p>

<p>To meet the national need there should be
established an interdepartmental Federal colonization
board with the following duties:</p>

<p>(1) To make community plans. This would
involve the location of settlements, their roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and building sites; plans for division of land into
farms; plans for erection of farm buildings; plans
for town sites and buildings as colony centers,
parks as playgrounds, etc., all to be surveyed
and put in working shape by the Reclamation
Service, Department of the Interior.</p>

<p>(2) To select suitable people for settlement on
the lands acquired and improved by the Reclamation
Service, with the preference to be
given to former soldiers.</p>

<p>(3) To distribute the selected immigrant settlers
of non-English mother tongue, including
soldiers, having in mind the need of mixing different
races with the native settlers so as to facilitate
the process of incorporating all into American
life.</p>

<p>(4) To plan and organize the economic life of
the colonies. This means the introduction of,
and instruction in, farming and methods of cultivation
suitable to the land, climate, and other
conditions surrounding the colony, the organization
of buying and selling co-operation in the
colonies, provision of markets, etc.</p>

<p>(5) To plan and organize the educational,
recreational, and general community life of the
colonies&mdash;schools, libraries, lectures, games, etc.</p>

<p>(6) To regulate and license or charter private
colonization companies.</p>

<p>Among the policies of the Colonization Board
a very prominent one should be a proper distribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
of the immigrant settlers. Owing to the
lack of any public plan or measures for the distribution
of the immigrants in the country in the
past the results have been astonishing. The
Little Polands, Italies, ghettos, Germanies, and
others in our great industrial centers are well
known, though the word "Little" is not applicable
in every case. It is especially inapplicable
where the compact immigrant settlements exceed
in numbers the largest cities of their home countries.
For instance, according to the last census
figures, there were in the city of New York
more Italians (including their children) than
the population of Rome, more Germans than
in Cologne, about as many Irish as the population
of Dublin and Belfast together, and about
three times as many Jews as there were in the
British Empire.</p>

<p>All this is already known to the public at
large. What is not popularly known is the fact
that there are foreign provinces in the agricultural
sections of the country. There whole
counties and even a number of neighboring
counties are populated by immigrants of the
same race and nationality. Such provinces have
become self-sufficient; they have their own
towns, their own schools, churches, industries,
stores, select local public officials of their own
nationality, speak their own tongue, and live
according to the traditions and spirit of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
home country. These traditions and this spirit
are kept alive by their schools, churches, and libraries,
and by the absence of any direct contact
with American customs and traditions. From
such localities came a considerable number of
the American-born drafted men who could not
speak, write, or even understand English.</p>

<p>Such foreign provinces in the rural sections of
the country are principally found in the North
Middle Western states and Western states.
When the writer, during his field investigation,
arrived in such localities&mdash;for instance, in the
southwestern part of North Dakota&mdash;he found
that the townspeople, business men, and public
officials, as a rule, understood English, but spoke
German or Scandinavian among themselves. In
talking with any man in the street the writer
had to resort to the man's mother tongue, while
the farmers back in the country, as a rule, did
not speak English at all. Yet many of them
were born in this country.</p>

<p>On the whole, the impression of the writer was
that the larger the rural immigrant colony, the
less it showed evidences of American influences.
This was quite apparent in regard to the Slavic
and especially the Polish colonies visited by the
writer in a number of states.</p>

<p>The immigrants already settled in large colonies
of one nationality cannot be redistributed,
but they can be reached by other means, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
which is an efficient public-school system, which
is dealt with in later chapters.</p>

<p>Measures should be undertaken for the distribution
of the new immigrant settlers so as to
avoid their congregation in large colonies of only
one nationality. The experience of private
land dealers and colonization companies shows
that it is not wise to settle a single immigrant
family among native settlers or the settlers of
another nationality. Such a family becomes lonesome
and sooner or later leaves the settlement.
Therefore the immigrants must be settled in
groups according to their nationalities.</p>

<p>The question is, how large such national groups
must be in order to keep the settlers in the colony
and at the same time to avoid their becoming
clannish and remaining untouched by American
influences for a generation or a number of generations.
The observation of the writer and his
interviews on this question with the people engaged
in colonization have led him to the conclusion
that such groups ought to be of from five
to fifteen families each, settled in the same
neighborhood among either groups of other
nationalities or native settlers.</p>

<p>Such distribution of the immigrant settlers
in smaller groups is favored by the immigrants
themselves. As a rule, they are eager to learn
American ways as soon as possible, and usually
accede with alacrity to distribution, provided no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
violent compulsion is used and they are directed
to land where they are able to make a success by
their investment and toil, without being cheated
or exploited. The writer discussed the size of a
rural immigrant group of the same nationality in
a number of the immigrant colonies. The settlers,
even the Russian sectarian peasants, believed
that if there were not less than five
families in one group no loneliness would be
experienced. If there were no more than ten or
fifteen families there would be no danger of their
becoming clannish and self-sufficient, for they
would of necessity have to deal with other
groups and intermingle with them for both
business and social purposes.</p>

<p>A rigid selection of settlers on the basis of
their ability to farm and to stay on the farm is
of prime importance. Among the applicants
for farms in new colonies there are three main
classes of people, each distinct from the others:
(1) those who have experience, knowledge, and
otherwise ability for land cultivation and the
capacity for sticking to a job. These should be
selected and will contribute to the success of the
colony, which ultimately depends upon the settlers
themselves; (2) those who are hunters for
easy pickings in the way of a piece of property or
for an opportunity for safe investment or for
speculation. These should be avoided as the
plague; and (3) those who are not suited for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
rural life and heavy toil on the land, mostly city
people who dream of changing their life for improvement
of their health in the country, for an
independent life, or for an easy-going life, of
fresh air, sunshine, flowers, and birds. Such
people are not able to make a success of farming
and should be avoided. These classes of applicants
are found among immigrants as well as
among natives, soldiers, and civilians.</p>

<p>How important the selection of settlers is for
the success of colonization and settlement on land
is shown by the close scrutiny of prospective
settlers made by the agents of modern private
colonization companies and also by certain state
immigration officials. They ask an applicant
about his supply of money or credit, about his
experience, about his past in detail, his habits,
his inclinations, and his aspirations. They judge
him by his appearance, his physique, and his
health. He is also questioned about his family
life; special attention is given to the attitude of
his wife toward rural life, her past experience,
the probability of her being satisfied and able to
stay permanently on the farm and carry the
heavy burdens of a farmer's wife. Finally, the
prospective settler is warned of the existing conditions
in the colony, of the heavy toil and the
difficulties, and of the long period of waiting
which must elapse before he can enjoy the results
of his investment and labors. Selection made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
this way will guarantee the success of a colonization
enterprise, be it public or private.</p>

<h3>EXTENSION OF PUBLIC CREDIT</h3>

<p>A last measure which is extremely important and
must not be overlooked in any planning for land
settlement is the extension of public credit to
settlers through the Federal Farm Loan Board.
This, of course, applies not only to the settlers in
the colonies established by the Federal Colonization
Board, but also to those of private colonization
companies regulated and chartered by
the Colonization Board, and to individual settlers.
There must be certain safeguards against
loss. To accomplish this there could be established
a settlers' credit division in the Federal
Farm Loan Bureau, with a special land colonization
credit fund. A similar plan was proposed in
the bill introduced by Representative Knutson,
May 27, 1919.<a name="FNanchor_F_3" id="FNanchor_F_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_3" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Some such provision is indispensable in any
comprehensive land policy, and should secure a
place in legislative enactment.</p>

<h3>CO-OPERATION INDISPENSABLE</h3>

<p>No amount of legislation or smooth-running
administrative machinery can provide, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
for one of the most fundamental factors in
modern small-farm production.</p>

<p>Every colony of small farmers nowadays needs
to provide for co-operation among its members.
There is no other way for them to enjoy the
technical advantages of large-scale farming in the
buying of seeds, stock, fertilizers, tools, machinery,
and other necessities at wholesale prices,
in the selling of farm products at the best prices;
in the establishment of creameries, etc. The
buying of necessary costly machines, such as
stumping machines, tractors, threshers, headers,
is beyond the financial power of an individual
settler. Even should he be able to acquire them,
he cannot use such machines to their full capacity
on his small piece of land. But in co-operation
settlers are able to buy the heavy machinery and
to use it to its fullest capacity. Mutual insurance
and credit established through co-operation are
another substantial assistance to the success of
the settlers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

    <p class="caption">THIS SETTLER STARTED TEN YEARS AGO WITH NO MONEY</p>
</div>

<p>The co-operative buying and selling organization
of a Finnish farming colony in upper Michigan
which the writer investigated in detail
proved to be a great money saver to the settlers.
The enterprise has grown from a small undertaking
into the largest business organization in
the town, with its great warehouse overshadowing
the railroad station. In the beginning the surrounding
native farmers and townspeople were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
hostile toward it. They both feared the competition
as well as the broader results of an undertaking
of "foreigners," led by their "demagogic
leaders." Its former opponents have radically
changed their attitude, and many are joining the
organization. They find that co-operation means
voluntary, concerted, and co-ordinated action
for the common advantage, and that it is not
contrary to the American spirit.</p>

<p>One of the leaders of the Finnish co-operative
association explained that the defects of the local
private stores served as the first inducement for
the settlers to establish a co-operative store.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The private stores usually set arbitrary and high prices
on the goods, which are often of poor quality and limited
variety. As a result, a co-operative store among our settlers
was established. We found that the association, in its
meetings and activities, served as a school for the development
of mutual understanding and fellow-feeling among its
members. In the direction of Americanization our co-operative
movement has done much good already. Its
success has made the native farmers respect us. A number
of them have already joined our association. Should our
enterprise grow wider it may be expected to unite the
farmers of different nationalities, immigrants and natives,
into one community.</p></div>

<p>The interviews of the writer with the native
farmers fully substantiated these statements of
the Finns. One of them said that when the Finnish
settlers came the native-born people did not
expect much good from them. They were looked
upon as strange intruders, entirely ignorant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
farming. But as time went on they made good
not only as farmers, but also as business men in
their co-operative buying and selling association.
They were found to be good, sober, and industrious
people.</p>

<p>The co-operative movement was apparent in
northern Wisconsin, where numerous co-operative
creameries have been organized among the
settlers of various nationalities. The carrying
of milk to the creamery results in the regular
meeting of settlers every day; business meetings
and other activities of the association afford
opportunities for the settlers to get together and
work together. In addition to this the immigrant
settler, as a member of the co-operative
association, comes face to face with the wider
business world&mdash;banks, railways, commission
merchants, manufacturers, market conditions,
price fluctuations, etc. As an individual producer
he comes to know the larger problems involved
in marketing his product and his vision and
understanding broaden.</p>

<p>Almost all immigrant settlers interviewed on
the subject of co-operation were in favor of it.
"Co-operation helps us!" were words often
used in answer to the question why they favor
co-operation. This "help" should not be understood
in the material sense only. Co-operative
action, though it begins in economics, extends
to and ends in the creation of ideal, socio-psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
values. The co-operator works and
fights in the spirit of solidarity. He satisfies his
wants through concerted action. His psychology
is more complex and his aims become higher
than those of a private individual.</p>

<p>Co-operation is a child of necessity. It cannot
be created by outside suggestion or mere preaching.
When there is a need and conditions are
favorable the co-operative movement comes into
being. Unquestionably the need for co-operation
is greater in the rural districts than in the cities,
and yet the rural conditions in many respects
make the development of co-operation more
difficult. The main obstacles, according to the
rural co-operators themselves, consist in the lack
of business connections and markets, in the absence
of knowledge of efficient business methods,
and in credit difficulties. It is hard to find an
able and trustworthy business manager for a
co-operative store in a village.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all difficulties, the co-operative
movement among farmers and especially
among immigrant settlers has lately begun to grow
with extreme rapidity. For instance, in 1917 in the
state of Wisconsin there were agricultural co-operative
associations in the following numbers: 380
creameries, 718 cheese factories, 98 feed and produce
associations, and 124 live-stock concerns.
<a name="FNanchor_F_4" id="FNanchor_F_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_4" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
One of the first difficulties in the way of
establishing a co-operative association is its
incorporation proceeding. Most of the states up
to this time have had no special laws covering
co-operative associations. In such cases they
have to be incorporated under the laws relating
to private companies or those covering charity
and public-welfare associations.</p>

<p>A number of states have enacted laws for the
promotion and protection of co-operation among
farmers. The Wisconsin law, Chapter 368, Laws
of 1911, makes provision for the establishment
of organizations conducting business on the
co-operative plan. No member is allowed to
own shares of a greater par value than one thousand
dollars. No member is entitled to more
than one vote. Dividends on the paid-up
shares are allowed to be no more than 6 per cent
per annum; 10 per cent on the net profits has
to be set aside as a reserve fund. When this has
accumulated up to 30 per cent of the paid-up
shares, 5 per cent goes to the educational fund
to be used for teaching co-operation. One half
of the remainder of the profits has to be paid as
a uniform dividend upon the amount of purchases
of shareholders and upon the wages and
salaries of the employees, while the other half
has to be paid to the nonshareholders on the
amount of their purchases.</p>

<p>In case of productive associations, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
co-operative creameries, or elevators, dividends
have to be paid on raw materials delivered. In
case an association is both a selling and productive
enterprise, the dividends may be divided
on both goods purchased and material
delivered. All concerns which do not comply
with the provisions of the above law are prohibited
to use the term "co-operative" as a
part of their corporate name or the designation
of their business.</p>

<p>According to the Nebraska law, Senate File
No. 88,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>the words "co-operative company, corporation, or association"
are defined to mean a company, corporation, or association
which authorizes the distribution of its earnings in
part or wholly on the basis of, or in proportion to, the amount
of property bought from or sold to members, or of labor
performed, or other service rendered to the corporation.
A co-operative concern has the power "to regulate and limit
the right of stockholders to transfer their stock, and to make
by-laws for the management of its affairs, and to provide
thereon the term and limitation of stock ownership, and for
the distribution of its earnings."</p></div>

<p>The California law, Civil Code, Secs. 653M
to 653S, provides for organization of agricultural,
viticultural, and horticultural co-operative associations
which shall not have a capital stock and
shall not be working for profit. Each such association
shall determine by its by-laws the amount
of membership fee, the number and qualifications
of members, conditions of voting, the methods of
business, and the division of earnings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
There is no question that every state must
have special legislation for co-operative associations
quite distinct from that relating to private
business concerns. A co-operative association
must have the legal power to regulate and limit
the right of shareholders to transfer their shares,
to make by-laws for the management of business,
to limit the share ownership, to decide on the
proportion and method of distribution of its
surplus earnings. It must limit dividends on
shares to the prevailing rate of interest and provide
a certain percentage for a reserve fund until
the latter has accumulated up to a certain proportion
of the capital invested. A part of the
remainder should be retained for educational and
other social-welfare purposes, the rest proportioned
to the amounts of goods purchased,
products contributed, or services rendered. The
co-operative law should provide for one-member-one-vote.
Irrespective of the number of shares
owned, or the goods purchased, or the products
contributed, or the services rendered, only one
vote should be granted to each member.</p>

<p>Aside from such legislation, each state, as in
New York, should have a special office with adequate
forces for the advice and direction of
farmers and settlers who desire to organize a co-operative
association, as well as for those who
have already established such an association and
are meeting with difficulties.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
RURAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES</h2>

<p>The term "Americanization" is used in two
senses. In the narrower one it applies to our
immigrant population only, and in a broader
sense it applies to everybody, natives and immigrants
alike. This means the Americanization of
America. This broader meaning embraces the
whole national life in all its conditions, tendencies,
and forms of expression.</p>

<p>When the writer accepted the invitation of the
Study of Methods of Americanization to make a
field investigation of rural developments from
the viewpoint of Americanization, he was certain
that the study must be conducted in relation to
the immigrant colonies only. The study of the
Americanization of America would lead us nowhere,
especially in view of the smallness of
available forces and the shortness of time. The
study must be confined, therefore, to the immigrant
elements of the population, and even then
it could only be a preliminary survey to reveal
the problems to be studied later in detail.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION</h3>

<p>But the first observations in the field study soon
convinced him that a broader scope is inevitable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
For instance, inquiry into the conditions of the
immigrants in relation to the acquisition of land
for cultivation necessarily led him to the general
land question in the country, land policies, land
laws, land-dealing methods. In even a more
striking way did the field study of immigrant
education in the rural districts lead to the question
of general public education in rural communities
regardless of their racial composition.</p>

    <p class="caption">THE LARGEST GIRL WON A PRIZE FOR SCHOLARSHIP</p>
</div>

<p>Education has always been more of a problem
in rural districts than urban. Evidence of this
is found in the 1910 Census, which shows that
for every illiterate person living in an urban
community there are approximately two living
in rural communities. The higher per cent of
illiteracy in the rural districts is even more
marked in the states where immigrants are
settling than in the country as a whole. In
New Mexico, Arizona, and California the ratio
is about 250 illiterates in the country to every
100 in the city. Among the foreign born in rural
districts in three of these states an exceptionally
high per cent of illiteracy prevails. For Texas
35 per cent, New Mexico 34 per cent, and Arizona
37 per cent, of the rural foreign born are illiterate&mdash;in
contrast to 13 per cent for the United States.
With the exception of Louisiana these per cents are
the highest in the country and presage a problem
that cannot be overlooked in a consideration of
land settlement for the foreign born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Equally significant are the 1910 comparisons
of the figures for immigrants' inability to speak
English in urban and rural communities. Although
the contrast for the country as a whole is
not so striking, being 21.9 per cent in cities as
compared with 25.2 per cent in rural districts,
the differences in the four states where new immigrants
are settling on farms are considerable.</p>

<p>Over 60 per cent of the foreign born in rural
communities in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona
are unable to speak English. The principal
foreign group is composed of Mexicans who
come from a non-English-speaking country which
has a high per cent of illiteracy. They go into
the rural communities of these border states,
where there is practically no schooling opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
either for learning the English language or
for learning to read and write. While only 22.4
per cent are not able to speak English in California
rural districts, this is more than twice as
many as are unable to speak it in California
cities. This is a high ratio in the one state in
the country which provides public settlement
projects. While these situations are perhaps
extreme, their existence is manifestly inexcusable
in a land which prides itself on educational opportunity
for all. There is virtually never equality of
opportunity in rural and urban communities, for
either native or foreign born, and the immigrant
who lives on the land is especially handicapped.</p>

<p>In another report<a name="FNanchor_G_2" id="FNanchor_G_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_2" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
of this study there is evidence
which points to lack of educational and
social opportunities in rural districts. The
average length of time after arrival in the country
before petitions for naturalization papers are
filed is tabulated by occupation for more than
twenty thousand cases. These figures show that,
for all occupational groups of any size, agricultural
workers take the longest time, about fourteen
years, before petitioning. The average
length of time for workers of all occupations is
about ten and a half years. Back from the currents
of life, with fewer opportunities to overcome
disqualifications, the farm worker does not
become a citizen as quickly as his city brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
The term "education" as applied especially
to the rural population is a very broad one. It
comprises everything which helps to elevate the
people materially as well as mentally and spiritually.
In this direction various educational
agencies are working. The most important of
them might be classified as follows:</p>

<p>Among these agencies the public school is the
foremost in the Americanization process. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
directly influences the children and through them
their parents&mdash;the adult immigrants.</p>

<h3>BRIDGING DIFFERENCES</h3>

<p>An observer of the home life of immigrant
families finds a marked difference between the
parents and the children who attend American
schools, as well as between the American-schooled
children and their European-schooled
brothers and sisters. These differences lead often
to friction and dissension in the families, and
though each difference may be concerned with a
trivial matter, yet in their entirety they represent
the variation of the American from the
immigrant.</p>

<p>The writer once entered the home of a large
Russian immigrant family just when a quarrel
between two sets of children was going on. The
European-trained children wanted the window
shades rolled entirely up, for the sake of more
light, while their American-bred brothers and
sisters insisted that the shades be left halfway
up, as the Americans have them.</p>

<p>Another illustration of these differences is
found in the fact that the immigrants are conservative
in clinging to their old-country diet.
The first breach is usually occasioned by pie&mdash;the
American national dessert. The immigrant
children learn about it and taste it in the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
cooking classes and also in the neighboring
American families, insisting that their mothers
make it also. As a result the pie appears on the
immigrant table, though in the poorer families
only on holidays.</p>

<p>In the case of language, the parents and their
European-schooled children continue to speak at
home their old-country tongue and read newspapers
and books in the same language. The
American-schooled children prefer to speak English
and read American newspapers and books,
taking a special pride in this. They answer their
parents in English, although the latter do not
always understand English. They call themselves
Americans, in distinction from their
European parents and older brothers and sisters.
"My father, mother, and older sisters are Poles,
but I am an American!" answered an American-born
Polish boy of about twelve years when
asked about his nationality.</p>

<p>"How do you know that you are an American?"</p>

<p>"I was born here and I speak the American
language."</p>

<p>In the Italian colony at Vineland, New Jersey,
to give only one instance, there was marked conflict
between the children who went to the public
schools and their parents over the use of the
Italian language. The children wanted to speak
English and some even refused to talk Italian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
though their parents wanted them to and tried
to teach them. The children commonly acted as
interpreters between Americans and their parents,
especially their mothers. Unfortunately,
they did not conceal their contempt for the latter
for failing to understand and use English.</p>

<p>Often such differences are so pronounced that
the immigrant parents are greatly grieved over
the "estrangement" caused by the influence of
the American public schools. This dissatisfaction
takes an especially acute form among the
sectarian immigrants. In San Francisco there are
over four hundred families of Russian sectarian
peasants&mdash;Molochans, Jumpers, etc. Their religion
opposes war and military service, and on
that account they were exempted from the draft.
Notwithstanding this, four or five of their young
boys volunteered, in spite of the opposition of
their parents and of the whole colony. When the
writer visited the colony last year the colonists
were much agitated and upset. They openly
cursed the American schools and the city streets
for ruining their boys spiritually. "If we can't
settle on land in the rural districts, then we
have to get out of America!" exclaimed the
aged leader. In rural districts, they think, they
would be able to keep their children from going
"astray." The street influence is absent and the
school-attendance law is not so severely enforced
as in the city, the immigrant leader believed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
In the Polish farming colony centered at South
Deerfield, Massachusetts, where the Polish children
all attend the American public schools, the
children learn English quickly and prefer everything
American to everything Polish. The
parents are very much distressed over losing
their children as Polish people. For this reason
the parents stated that they were extremely eager
to establish their own Polish school where they
could teach their children the Polish language
and Polish history. Only lack of money has so
far prevented the founding of such a parochial
school.</p>

<h3>PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS</h3>

<p>When an immigrant group is planning either a
parochial or some other type of private school of
its own, one of its arguments is always that this
school will keep the children in its own group,
racially and religiously.</p>

<p>The North Middle Western states&mdash;Michigan,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, the Dakotas, Nebraska&mdash;have
large immigrant groups. In the
rural districts of those states it is a fact that
where there exists a private or parochial school,
the public school is neglected, poorly equipped,
and has a very small attendance.</p>

<p>A county superintendent of schools in Minnesota
reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
One of our greatest drawbacks in attendance is the
parochial schools. These retard the attendance and keep
the school terms down.
<a name="FNanchor_G_3" id="FNanchor_G_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_3" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></div>

<p>A county superintendent in South Dakota writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In a number of districts the attendance is so small, owing
to the fact that many attend the parochial school, that
interest and enthusiasm are lacking.
<a name="FNanchor_G_4" id="FNanchor_G_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_4" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></div>

<p>Another report from Minnesota states that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>the poorest schools in the country are in communities
where there are private schools in connection with a church.</p>

<p>The children attend these for years at a time, and when
they return to the public schools find themselves behind
their former companions.
<a name="FNanchor_G_5" id="FNanchor_G_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_5" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></div>

<p>In 1915&ndash;16 there were in the state of Wisconsin
78 rural public schools enrolling five or fewer
children, and 445 rural public schools enrolling
six to ten children. The state school authorities
explained to the writer that the small enrollment
in certain public schools does not always indicate
that there are not enough children of school age
in the district or that the children do not enroll.
Very often in the same district there is a well-developed
parochial or private school attended
by immigrant children. The parents prefer these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
schools to the public schools for racial and religious
reasons, and contribute liberally to their
development and maintenance.</p>

<p>In a number of cases where there are public
and private schools in immigrant localities, the
writer observed an active and intentional neglect
of the public schools by the local school
authorities. For instance, in some cases where
the state gives a certain sum of money for the
support of the public schools, the money is deposited
in the bank instead of being used for the
development of the public schools. Such deliberate
neglect of the public schools by the immigrant
local school leaders was quite conspicuous
in the state of Wisconsin.</p>

<hr class="line" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<h2>IX<br />
PRIVATE SCHOOLS</h2>

<p>One of the greatest negative agencies, and in
a large number of cases consciously negative
agencies, affecting the Americanization of immigrants
in our rural districts has been private
schools. Among these&mdash;the writer wishes to be
entirely outspoken&mdash;the most conspicuous have
been immigrant Catholic and Lutheran parochial
schools and Hebrew schools.</p>

<p>Many of them are run in the spirit of preference
for the old country and for the immigrant race
or nationality to America and the American
nationality. Furthermore, the very spirit and
aim of their methods are foreign to America.
In their training of children they lay special
stress on discipline, obedience, on the form of
things, on punctuality, on memory, and on
mechanism. All these qualities have been desirable
in the "subjects" and in the small "subject
nations," from the point of view of the monarchical
and aristocratic European regimes, with
which Catholicism and Lutheranism have been
identified, or of the Talmud, upon which extreme
Hebrew nationalism is based.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
The authorities of parochial schools, especially
the higher authorities, such as bishops, allow
themselves to criticize sternly the American
public schools for looseness, too much freedom,
lack of moral teachings, etc. A prominent German
Catholic bishop, who has been for thirty
years in America and who can hardly speak
English, stated to the writer that the American
colleges, high schools, and even public schools
are no good, that their aim is to prepare children
and students to get easier jobs, to get along in
life without labor and effort. Religious and
moral teachings are entirely lacking in his opinion
and the schools work against these teachings.
Especially, the training of girls in America is
entirely wrong. They are not educated to be
good housewives, but are just reared for an easy
and joyful life; in fact, girls are too lazy to do
family work or any work. The severely nationalistic
churchman was unable to approve the
democratic spirit of the American public school
with the stress which it lays upon freedom of
action, self-reliance, initiative, and imagination
in children. He looked upon children as if they
were somebody's property or tools, not human
beings with individual destinies.</p>

<p>How important the parochial schools are considered
to be by certain immigrant nationalistic
leaders and high clergy is shown by the speeches
delivered at the southeastern Wisconsin district<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
conference of the Evangelical Lutheran Joint
Synod of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, and
other states, held in the summer of 1918. Prof.
A. Piper stated that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>we must concentrate all our powers upon keeping our hands
on our schools. To hold our schools we must compete with
the public schools, must hold classes five days a week, and
must work with all the strength that is in us. The most
important part of all of our missionary work is the work in
our schools.</p></div>

<p>The importance of concentrating effort on the
parochial schools was further emphasized by
W. Grabner, Milwaukee, who asked:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What has made Chicago the greatest Lutheran city in the
world? [and replied] I say it was the Lutheran parochial
school. It has served as a nucleus for all Lutheran families
to settle about. Round it all life and activity centered.
Our Lutheran forefathers nourished the little Lutheran
schools with all the powers they possessed.</p></div>

<p>The situation in the rural districts of various
states in regard to the private and especially
the parochial schools in connection with the
Americanization of the children of immigrants
born here and abroad is shown by the following
field notes and material collected by the writer.</p>

<h3>NEBRASKA</h3>

<p>The Nebraska State Council of Defense made a
report on the foreign-language schools in Nebraska,
dated January 14, 1917. The data were
secured through the personal investigation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Miss Sarka Hrbkova, chairman of the Woman's
Committee, aided by Miss Alice Florer of the
State Superintendent's office, and through the
efforts of the county chairmen of educational
propaganda of the Woman's Committee. Professors
Link and Weller and other representatives
of the German Evangelical Lutheran Church of
the Missouri Synod co-operated with Miss
Hrbkova. The following facts indicate the extent
of parochial schools in Nebraska.
<a name="FNanchor_H_1" id="FNanchor_H_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_1" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Foreign-language schools are located in 59 counties of
Nebraska. There is a total of 262 schools in which it is
estimated that 10,000 children receive instruction in foreign
languages, chiefly the German. In these 262 schools 379
teachers are employed. Five thousand five hundred and
fifty-four children are attending the schools of the German
Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Missouri Synod, this
number including those in the summer sessions as well.
About 20 teachers give instructions in their homes or in
church buildings. Of these 379 teachers in private schools,
2 give instruction in Danish, 6 in Polish, 14 in Swedish,
and 357 in German. Less than 2 per cent of the teachers of
these schools are certified. About 120 of the German
teachers are likewise ministers in the German Lutheran
parish where the school is located. The county superintendents
of the 59 counties in which the foreign-language
schools are located reported that in only a few cases do
these schools give the equivalent of the eighth-grade public
school. For the most part, the eight years' attendance at
such a school fits pupils for the sixth grade of the public
schools.</p>

<p>In certain schools in Fillmore, Cass, Franklin, Gosper,
Jefferson, Pawnee, and Wayne Counties the instruction is
given entirely in the German language. In about 200 of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the schools three hours daily is devoted to instruction in
the German language.</p>

<p>In Deuel, Fillmore, and Jefferson Counties the superintendents
report that the German national hymn is sung in
certain foreign-language schools. In Nance and Washington
Counties they report that it was formerly sung, but not
this year. In Cedar Creek District No. 88, Cass County,
Reverend Kunzendorf, teacher, states that they do not sing
the American hymn because they do not sing any hymns at
all. The American national hymn is not sung in about 100
of the German-language schools. Over 100 foreign-language
schools lack an American flag. One minister, Rev. J. Aron,
from Wayne County, writes, "We have no flag, but will
see to it that one be put up, if requested to do so." In
Madison the minister declared foreign-language and parochial
schools are not required by law to have an American
flag, and therefore he does not display one.</p>

<p>Public schools have been closed and forced out by German
parochial schools in Cedar County, Cheyenne County, Clay
County, Colfax County (No. 36), Gage County (No. 103),
2 in Johnson County, 5 in Platte County, District No. 99
in Saline County, 8 in Seward County, No. 38 in Stanton
County and Wayne County. In Cedar County the Bow
Valley, Constance, and Fordyce schools are taught by
Sisters. In the following counties there are public schools
with only four or five pupils, because the German-language
schools absorb the pupils: Clay, Cedar, Cuming, Dixon,
Howard, Nuckolis, Platte, Polk, Seward, Stanton, Wayne,
and Webster.</p></div>

<p>The following statement was made by Prof.
C. F. Brommer, Hampton, Nebraska, president
of the Lutheran Synod of Missouri, at the
hearing before the state Americanization Committee
held in Lincoln in September, 1918:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I think we have more parochial schools than any other
Protestant body in this state; between 150 and 160, with
about 5,000 children in these schools.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
In answer to a question by a member of the
committee, Professor Brommer said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I know of one [public school] district where there is no
public school. There is no need of one, as the children all
go to parochial school. There are a few such cases.</p></div>

<p>George Weller, of Seward, Nebraska, stated
to the same committee:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>German has never been taught in our schools [German
Lutheran] as an end, but as a means to an end. We could
not teach the old folks English, and in order to allow the
children and the parents to worship together we taught
the children the German language.</p></div>

<p>J. W. Robb of Lincoln informed the commission that
in one district the Germans control the
public-school board and they closed the public
school two months in a year, and the children are
deprived of two months in English schools or
must go to a German parochial school during
that time.</p>

<h3>NORTH DAKOTA</h3>

<p>The situation in regard to parochial schools in
North Dakota has been and still is, perhaps, more
serious than in Nebraska. The writer in his field
study in North Dakota was impressed that the
public officials were afraid to do anything more
than recommend certain desirable changes in
these schools; some were even afraid to visit
the German counties or sections on public business,
such as Liberty Bond or Red Cross drives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Several reasons were given, such as politics,
ignorance of the German language, and even
care for their own safety. Therefore an English-speaking
German woman was engaged to speak
for Liberty Bonds in North Dakota German sections.
She was successful only because in her
German public speeches she praised the Brest-Litovsk
Peace Treaty and condemned the
Czechoslovaks in Russia. "Well, she brings
home the bacon. For what else do we care!"
ironically exclaimed a North Dakota man to the
writer.</p>

<p>The State Superintendent of Public Education
made the following statement to the writer
when he asked for data on the foreign-language
schools in the state:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The State Department of Public Education has no authority
whatever over the private and parochial schools in
the state. There is no legal ground for collecting information
in regard to them.... There have been cases when
children of immigrant groups, attending a private or parochial
school, had to learn the foreign tongue of other
groups.</p></div>

<p>A Catholic bishop stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The first grades in the parochial schools use German because
the children who enter the schools do not know English,
and it is far better and more successful to start work
with them in their mother tongue as a teaching language.
At the same time, they teach them English. As their knowledge
of English gradually grows, the teaching in the higher
grades is transferred to the English language.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
To the writer's question whether the non-German
children in their parochial schools&mdash;for
instance, Bohemians and Hungarians&mdash;have also
to start in German, the bishop said that in some
cases this is true, for they are not able to find
teachers for each language.</p>

<p>In the bishops diocese there are 37,000 Catholic
families. Among these are 2,000 Indian
families, about 2,000 Bohemian families, and
between 300 and 400 Hungarian families. The
rest are German families, over 100 of whom are
from Germany; about 2,000 were born in America,
and the rest are Germans from Russia.</p>

<p>An American church head made the following
statement, in reply to an inquiry about the
schools:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Strasburg, Emmons County, has a large parochial school
where German is the only language both for teaching and
speaking. The public school there has only a handful of
children. There are plenty of parochial schools in which
German is taught exclusively in McIntosh and Emmons
Counties, and in the western counties (in the town of New
Salem, etc.). Some of the teachers, of whom a goodly number
are Sisters, cannot speak English at all. Children of
other nationalities would also be under German influences.
There is undoubtedly German propaganda in these schools,
and American or other children become Germanized. Every
graded school, private and public, should be conducted in
English exclusively. Every teacher need not be American
born; many foreign-born people are better citizens than some
native Americans. But every teacher should have to understand
and speak the English language. No one should teach,
preach, or hold public office who cannot speak English.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
The editor of an English daily in Bismarck,
North Dakota, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Americanization work is weakest in North Dakota,
and yet it is more needed here than anywhere else, for the
population is mainly composed of foreign elements. Foreign-language
churches, parochial and other private schools, and
certain American public schools in which, as it is in a number
of places, the teaching language is a foreign language,
very often German&mdash;are keeping the old country alive in
the state. We have a large number of the second generation,
grown-up people born here of foreign-born parents,
who do not know how to write or read English, who do not
know anything about America, but know well the history
of Hohenzollern and Hapsburg dynasties in Europe.</p></div>

<p>A leader of the Women's Organization, North
Dakota Council of Defense, made the following
statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Red Cross work, food-conservation work, and child-welfare
work are organized in every county, a wide-awake
woman being chosen as county head. Great difficulty is
experienced in reaching the foreigner. A large number of
them, especially women, do not understand English, and do
not know enough about the country, its traditions, and
spirit. Aside from remaining foreigners, they are in many
cases unbelievably ignorant. For instance, the organization
undertook a baby census, which included weighing the babies.
The baby of a German housewife was underweight&mdash;that is,
below normal. When its mother learned of this she began to
cry hysterically. After the other people succeeded in quieting
her she expressed the fear that the American government
would kill her baby for being below normal weight.</p></div>

so that these schools could not teach the branches unless
the teachers were as well equipped as the public-school

the confirmation age for two years.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Parochial schools should be required to report to the

of term, etc. The teachers should be required to make
monthly reports and be subject to the same supervision of
inspection as those of public schools. Their certification
should also be subject to state approval. Failing this, the
pupils should be required to attend the public schools for
at least eight full years, or until they complete the regular
eighth-grade work.</p></div>

<p>Near St. Cloud, Minnesota, there is a Slovenian
colony of about fifty to sixty families. Near by
there is a much smaller German colony with a
German parochial school in which the teacher,
at the time of the writer's visit, was a German
and the teaching language was German. Quite
a number of the Slovenian families sent their
children to this school, where they were Germanized
instead of Americanized. A Slovenian
family head explained to the writer that those
Slovenians who are sending their children to the
German school do it for a practical reason. They
expect some time to visit their native Austria,
where German is the state language. The man
claimed that about one tenth of the settlers do
not understand English, and that only about
one fifth of them can speak and write English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
although the colony was founded in America
about fifty years ago.</p>

<h3>MICHIGAN</h3>

<p>The following statement made by the Superintendent
of Public Instruction in the state of
Michigan to the writer, September 11, 1918,
shows the situation in regard to the private
schools in that state. Parochial schools exist as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One hundred and sixty-six Catholic; 124 German Lutheran;
19 Adventists; 22 Christian Reform. There is a
total of 331. Of these, 190 maintain as many as eight
grades, and 62 maintain more than eight grades. In the
grades below the high school there is an attendance of 43,836,
and in the high schools, 2,813. There are employed about
1,200 teachers. Eighty-six schools use German as a medium
of instruction, German partly; sixteen use Polish; 5 use
French. Only 2 schools in the state give no time to the
teaching of the English branches. Seventy per cent of all
the schools use the English language only as a medium of
instruction. The census of the state contains 892,787
children of school age, five to nineteen years, inclusive.
There are enrolled in the public schools of the state, 635,020.
We regret that we have not yet the data from Saginaw and
Detroit. The city of Detroit alone would perhaps show a
parochial-school attendance as large as the parochial-school
attendance of all the rest of the state.</p></div>

<p>In a Finnish colony in upper Michigan the
writer found three one-month religious summer
schools, well attended. One of the leaders of the
colony stated that they have only Finnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
teachers in these schools and the teaching is in
Finnish. The program contains mainly religious
instruction and a limited amount of Finnish
history. The expenses are paid by the church
treasury. The people want these schools for
maintaining their religion among the children as
well as for sentimental nationalistic reasons.
The schools are conducted in the public-school
rooms during summer vacations.</p>

<p>In the same section of the state the writer
visited an old and comparatively large Polish
colony, located at Posen. His field notes supply
the following information: There is at the
church a four-room parochial school, housed in
a substantial brick building, with five teachers,
including the priest. The school year lasts ten
months. Teaching is in English, except that an
hour each day is devoted to the Polish language
and Polish history. The priest admitted that
the teaching of religion is in Polish. The school
program is the same as in the standard public
schools of eight grades. The same textbooks
are used. Although the law does not require
examination of the children, nevertheless to
appease the county officials and show the efficiency
and value of their school they send the
children to the county board of education for
examination, and the county board has always
expressed great satisfaction with the advancement
in education of the children of the Polish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
school. The teachers are all Poles, appointed by
the bishop, candidates being presented by the
priest.</p>

<p>The need of this school the priest explained as
follows: It Americanizes the children more
quickly than the American school&mdash;that is, it is
more efficient in teaching the children the American
ways of life and American history than the
American public schools, for the teachers are all
Poles, know their people and their psychology
better than do the teachers in the public schools.
During a later discussion the priest admitted
that the church service is in the Polish language
and that the Polish school exists rather for sentimental
reasons of a racial character than for
practical reasons. The settlers also claimed that
the Polish school and the church service in the
Polish language are needed, for the reason that
they like this better; they complained that the
expenses are too high; they would have the
county or state help them. Sometimes a few
adults come to the school, but they are irregular
in attendance.</p>

<p>The priest explained that the issue of the immigrant
schools in the state has become practically
a political issue, and to his mind it ought not to
be, at least not in such a sharp form. Prohibition
of these schools would have a bad effect on the
foreign-born population. The schools might be
modified and reformed and the state might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
exercise some sort of control and supervision
over them, but only so far as it is agreeable to the
colonies themselves. In this way the schools
would be a valuable asset to the education
of the people. They would work toward Americanization,
better than the ordinary public
schools, for they can reach the depths of the
soul more easily than the American schools.
He believed that his school would be an ideal
means to this end.</p>

<p>The writer observed in this colony that the
majority of the colonists are of the second and
third generations. Not many families are
foreign born. The colony is on the way to
Americanization. The main causes holding it
back are as follows: the colony is to a large
degree isolated from the outside world; the
Catholic Church and its schools are keeping
the Polish language and the racial characteristics
very much alive. The writer heard in the town
grown-up people talking Polish. All the people
the writer met spoke English fluently. In the
street he noticed several groups of children
playing; some spoke Polish, some English. Two
boys were talking together, one speaking Polish,
the other English. In watching and hearing the
boys, the writer felt the influence of the Polish
church and school over them. The faces and
build of the people have a specific Slavic character.
Otherwise their appearance is American.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
At Holland, Ottawa County, Michigan, there
is a large long-established Dutch colony, the
vast majority of the settlers being already of the
second and third generations. The colony is far
advanced on the way to Americanization. The
writer found the town and farming districts surrounding
it almost the same as any native rural
district. He did not hear any Dutch spoken in
the streets, stores, or public offices. Yet the
Dutch language was the language of the service
in the churches and the teaching language in the
parochial schools up to recent years. In regard
to this fact the local church head explained to the
writer:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Aside from a number of lower parochial schools, there is
one parochial high school and one parochial college, Hope
College. The high school is a preparatory school for the
college. The college prepares ministers for the village
churches. The language used in the high school and college
was formerly Dutch. They taught Dutch history, literature,
and mainly religion&mdash;Bible study. But during late years
English has become the teaching language, and the Dutch
language has remained only as a subject of study. Up to
this time the leaders of the colony have been working
toward Americanization unconsciously, but now they have
awakened to the fact that the Dutch are rapidly Americanizing.
They accept this fact as a desirable one, and are now
working consciously toward the end of Americanization.
They realize that even if they would like to keep the Dutch
nationality alive in the colony, they would not be able to
do it, so that they yield to the inevitable. The activities in
the church and parochial schools have now to be turned
more toward Americanization.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
In a German colony at Au Gres, Michigan, the
writer learned that the colonists have a parochial
school in which the teaching is in German. They
teach the German language, the Lutheran religion,
and the rudiments of sciences. The
church is composed entirely of Germans. Both
ministers are appointed by the German Synod.
The Congregational church has Saturday and
Sunday school. The Saturday school lasts from
nine until twelve in the morning, and the Sunday
school from nine until ten in the morning. The
teaching is in German; the subject is Bible
study, and also the learning of the German
language and the singing of hymns. The meaning
of these schools was explained to the writer
by the settlers as follows: The parents would
like to have their children know the German
language, be able to read and write German, and
be instructed in religious matters, for neither
German nor religion is taught in the American
schools. The local native settlers stated to the
writer that the German parochial school ought
not to be there. It is a Germanizing school,
opposed to America and Americanization, they
argued.</p>

<h3>WISCONSIN</h3>

<p>The Superintendent of Public Education of the
State of Wisconsin told the writer that there is
no law enabling the public authorities to supervise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
or inspect the private schools or even to collect
information in regard to them, except in a
roundabout way. There is a law requiring that
the county boards keep records of school attendance
and this law enables the county boards
to learn the attendance of every school in each
county. The enrollment in private and parochial
schools in Wisconsin was as follows:</p>

<p>There was a case in Wisconsin in 1918 of a
German father sentenced to five years in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
penitentiary for persuading his son to evade the
draft. An editorial commenting on the case said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This man, though German in every sense of the word, was
born in America. Yet when he was on trial he had great
difficulty in understanding questions put to him in English.
Born in America, educated in American schools, nearly fifty
years old, yet "he had great difficulty in understanding
questions put in English!" Why? Because in the German&mdash;not
American&mdash;community in which he was raised the
education of American citizens was conducted in German.</p></div>

<p>A rural postmaster of German descent in a
small backwoods town in Wisconsin, who claimed
to have lost long ago his faith in "the Kaiser's
Fatherland," as he put it, stated that there are
thousands and thousands of such victims of the
German parochial schools in the state, who,
though born and brought up here, are unable to
converse freely in English. This is especially
true among those who live on farms in a German
colony and go only to a German school and
church.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now these people suffer and are ashamed of themselves.
But who is responsible? I think both the German clergy
and other leaders for victimizing these people, as well as the
American public for allowing such mischief.</p></div>

<h3>SOUTH DAKOTA</h3>

<p>In regard to the situation in South Dakota, the
Federal Bureau of Education reports (Bulletin,
No. 31, 1918) that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
some counties, Hutchinson, for example, are largely peopled
by German stock. A large portion of the school population
attend German Catholic and German Lutheran parochial
schools in which German has been used largely as a medium
of instruction. (Recently stopped by order of the State
Council of Defense.) In this county, and in Hanson County,
the German-Russian Mennonites still live the quaint community
life brought with them from Russia. German, not
English, is the language of the villages, although in most of
the schools English is the medium of instruction.</p></div>

<h3>CALIFORNIA</h3>

<p>The California Commissioner of Public Education
stated to the writer that the state authorities
have no right to interfere in any way with the
private and parochial schools and that he is not
legally able to collect any information in regard
to these schools.</p>

<p>Even the leaders of the Russian sectarian
peasant colonies maintain some sort of a private
school of their own. The San Francisco colony
has classes for children two evenings a week, in
which they are taught reading and writing in the
Russian language. In Los Angeles the colony
leaders explained that their children learn the
Russian language in their homes, where Russian
is spoken exclusively, and that they learn Russian
reading and writing in their Russian private
evening schools, one hour each evening. The
peasants themselves teach them. The parents
have to pay certain small sums to the teachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
The leaders expressed a keen desire that the
city should provide them with a Russian school,
for they would like to have their children able
to read, speak, and write the Russian language.
If they should not be able to settle in America
on the land they would be compelled to return
to Russia. The leaders of the Russian colony at
Glendale, Arizona, said that they are attempting
to teach Russian to their children in the evenings
and other spare time, but owing to lack of time
and proper teachers they have not made much
progress.</p>

<h3>HEBREW SCHOOL IN NEW JERSEY</h3>

<p>The local manager of the Hirsch fund in Woodbine,
New Jersey, a Jewish colony, stated that
there is in the colony a Hebrew school supported
by individuals and to a certain degree by the
Hirsch fund. It is a Hebrew school connected
with activities of the synagogue, maintained for
religious purposes. It corresponds to the parochial
school of Christian churches. About sixty
pupils attend this school.</p>

<h3>OPINIONS ON BOTH SIDES</h3>

<p>It goes without saying that during war-time
excitement, with its heightened suspicion, the
statements made by the defenders of the foreign-language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
schools and their opponents do not
always correspond to the reality. It has been the
writers impression that the defenders were inclined
to diminish the negative influence of these
schools, while their opponents in a number of cases
saw these schools darker than they really were.</p>

<p>For instance, it was a usual experience of the
writer, when he arrived in an immigrant colony
and explained either to individual leaders or to
a meeting of the whole colony the purpose of his
inquiry, to receive at the outset the following
answer: "Well, we are all Americanized; we are
all Americans; we understand and speak the
American language and love the country; we are
not a colony at all, but just plain American people
of a certain old-country stock," etc. When
it developed that the language of their church
service and the teaching language in their private
schools was their old-country language, the
leaders began, with certain embarrassment, to
admit that the old folks and the late arrivals do
not understand English, and therefore the mother
tongue of the parents becomes the home language
for both the young and old. And since some
settlers intend to return to the old country, and
do not like to lose their former nationality&mdash;their
old-country tongue is used in the churches
and taught in the schools.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Polish settlers were most outspoken
in their attachment to their nationality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
while the German settlers were either silent or
denied their preference for the German nationality;
their main argument in favor of the use of
German in their churches and schools was based
on purely religious grounds. It was solely on this
religious ground that they explained the higher
proportion of German-language schools to the
number of German immigrants than obtains in
any other immigrant national group. The Jews
claimed that their racial characteristics, such as
diet, moral conceptions according to the Mosaic
laws, and study of Hebrew history, were really
contributions to America. They justified on this
ground the cultivation of their racial differences,
maintaining that there is nothing in this opposed
to American ideals, but that, on the contrary, it
is in accord with what this country stands for
and fosters.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the opponents of foreign-language
schools often viewed them as the sole
hindrance to the better understanding and
acceptance of American ways and institutions,
the creators of disloyalty. They would close all
foreign-language schools in the country at once,
without any further consideration.</p>

<p>As a result of the war-time revelations and
excitement, certain changes have taken place in
these schools. In a number of states the use of
a foreign tongue as a teaching medium and even
as a subject of study in the common schools has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
been prohibited. In a number of places the immigrant
leaders themselves have voluntarily
changed their teaching language to English
under the pressure of both public opinion in
general and that of the members of their own
group. "It is an injustice to our own people if
we teach them a foreign tongue instead of the
language of this country," stated a Lutheran
pastor to the writer.</p>

<p>But in many cases the nationalistic leaders
expressed their dissatisfaction with the changes
"enforced" upon them. They expressed the
opinion that after peace is established their people
would have things their own way through
their votes. Many of them are already naturalized
and still more are going to be.</p>

<h3>TEMPORARY USEFULNESS</h3>

<p>The elementary foreign-language schools undoubtedly
perform a service in preventing the
disruption of families and are justified to this
extent. The question arises, however, whether
much more cannot be done to assist the parents,
through evening schools and home teachers, to
learn the language and customs of the country.
If this work could be adequately done, it would
not be necessary to hold the children back by
teaching them a foreign language, only to be used
to bridge a temporary gulf in their homes.</p>

<p>The justification for foreign-language elementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
schools does not apply to the higher institutions.
In the Dutch colony at Holland, Michigan,
the writer was struck by the fact that
while the people were largely Americanized and
English had become their home or mother
tongue, the colony leaders insisted on the Dutch
language in their high school and college. The
only explanation given was that this was done
unconsciously. During recent years they had
become conscious of the need and the inevitableness
of Americanization, and, as a result, had
substituted English for Dutch in their higher
schools.</p>

<p>The Jewish colony in Woodbine, New Jersey,
had a Jewish agricultural college, supported by
the Hirsch fund. To the writer's inquiries as to
why there was need of a special Jewish agricultural
college, why the Jewish boys cannot enter
American agricultural colleges, receiving scholarships
from the Hirsch fund if need be, the
answers of the authorities were varied: They had
to follow the will of Baron de Hirsch; in a
special Jewish institution the Jewish boys are
kept from "going astray"; teaching and training
can be better adjusted to the peculiarities of
the Jewish boys, etc.</p>

<h3>NEED FOR REGULATION</h3>

<p>There is no question that the foreign-language
private schools have done great harm to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
country as a whole and to the immigrants themselves.
The question is, What has to be done?</p>

<p>The parochial schools must be regulated by
the following measures: All elementary private
schools should be licensed or registered in the
office of the public-school authorities; all should
meet the same requirements as the elementary
public schools in regard to the qualifications of
teachers, school terms, program, teaching language,
and inspection and direction by the public-school
authorities. Exception might be made to
permit religious instruction certain definite hours
during the week to the American-born children in
English and to recently arrived immigrant children
in their mother tongue as well as instruction in
their mother tongue as an extra cultural subject.
The lessons should be given by a duly qualified
teacher.</p>

<p>In another volume
<a name="FNanchor_H_5" id="FNanchor_H_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_5" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> of these Studies there is
a further discussion of a successful experiment
along this line. The parochial schools of New
Hampshire have co-operated voluntarily with the
state authorities. Progress toward regulation
and the establishment of a minimum standard in
all schools in the state has been made. Only
through some such provision can this country
insure equal opportunity to its potential citizens.</p>

<h2>X<br />
IMMIGRANT CHURCHES</h2>

<p>Immigrant or foreign-language churches are
needed by the immigrants so long as they have
not learned to understand the English language.
But for those immigrants who have been long
enough in this country to know English and for
the immigrants' children born in America no
foreign-language churches are needed. If the
church authorities conduct the church services
and activities in a foreign tongue for those immigrants
who understand and speak English, they
then do this for racial or nationalistic reasons&mdash;as
a service to the old country or to a nationality
other than the American nationality. That this
is often the case is shown by the fact that certain
foreign countries have been financially supporting
churches here for their people who have come to
America; for instance, the former Russian
monarchy gave liberally for the establishment
and upkeep of Russian Greek Orthodox churches
in this country.</p>

<p>In the use of foreign language in nearly all the
rural colonies visited by the writer where there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
was an immigrant church, the language used in
the church services was the old-country tongue,
although occasionally the services were bilingual,
both English and the foreign tongue being used.</p>

<p>In North Dakota an American minister described
the situation as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Most of the German Catholic and Lutheran church services
are in German; some are bilingual. The Lutherans
almost entirely have all-German services. In the western
part of the state a Bohemian or a Slav can get only the
German tongue. Scandinavian churches also use their own
tongue. All foreign churches here use their own languages.
Quite a number of foreign ministers are foreign born. Some
can scarcely speak English.</p></div>

<p>At a hearing before the state Americanization
Committee in Lincoln, Nebraska, held in the
fall of 1918, a large number of the priests and
pastors of immigrant churches testified as to the
use of the old-country language in their church
services and pleaded for its retention. It was
apparent from the testimony that the foreign-language
church service was prevalent throughout
the state in the immigrant churches. Practically
every priest or pastor claimed that the
majority of his congregation could not understand
services in English.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the testimony are
characteristic. Peculiar emphasis was laid by
the church authorities upon the fact that although
the people might understand and speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
English fluently in their everyday affairs, yet
they could not understand church service or
religious instruction when these were given in
English.</p>

<p>Statement of H. F. Hensick, Madison, Nebraska,
pastor of German Evangelical Lutheran
Church:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In my own congregation in Madison there are thirty-six
who are not able to understand the religious instruction in
English; they are those who were born in this country or
who came here years back.</p></div>

<p>Statement of Richard Kuehne, Lincoln, Nebraska:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have in Lincoln about eight thousand German-Russian
people; the most of them cannot follow an English
sermon at all.</p></div>

<p>Statement of M. Lehninger, Plattsmouth, Nebraska,
representing Evangelical Lutheran General
Synod of Wisconsin and other states:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While there are a good many people who do understand
English well and speak it quite fluently in everyday conversation,
they all have had their religious instruction in
German, and they understand a German sermon where they
cannot understand an English one. The people of my
church have come partly from Germany and partly from
Canada, and many communicant members are native-born
American citizens, and still it is a fact that perhaps only half
a dozen members of the two hundred and fifty communicant
members will have the full benefit of an English sermon.</p></div>

<p>Statement of Vic Anderson, Minden, Nebraska,
Swedish Lutheran:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
It is my judgment that 35 per cent of our people do not
understand preaching in the American language. They can
do business in that language, but when it comes to understanding
the interpretation of the Bible, they would like to
have it in the Swedish language because that is the language
that their fathers and mothers taught them in.</p></div>

<p>Statement of John H. Steger, Plattsmouth,
Nebraska, St. Paul German Church:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Half of my congregation cannot understand the English
language.</p></div>

<p>Statement of C. F. Brommer, Hampton, Nebraska,
Lutheran pastor:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In every congregation, but mostly in the congregations of
the city, we have people who understand the English sermon
as well as the German sermon, and then I think the majority
speak, read, and write English, in common, everyday life,
perfectly, but they still would derive greater benefit from
the German than the English sermon, and I think there are
probably nearly 98 per cent of our congregations and people
who do not understand the English sermons and never will
learn to understand them. These are mostly old people.
When they came here they did not have the time nor the
opportunity to learn the English language.</p></div>

<p>Statement of Adolph Matzner, Lincoln, Nebraska,
representing the Nebraska district of the
German Evangelical Synod of North America:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The majority of the voting members of our congregation
are immigrants. They came to this country thirty or forty
years ago; they settled in the country; they had no opportunity
to get acquainted and to learn the American language.
In the country and small towns they have no night schools,
and these people never had a chance to learn the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
language. We have members in the congregation who are
able to understand it, or at least able to do their business in
the American language. They can talk to you about politics
and about the weather, but they cannot get the benefit from
an American sermon that they can from a German sermon.
They would perhaps understand a sermon on how to keep
cool on a hot day, but when you come to a sermon on
religious subjects they are not able to understand it.</p></div>

<p>Most of the priests and pastors stated that
there were so many difficulties in the way of
having separate English and foreign-language
services, the former for the children and those
who understand English, and the latter for the
old people who do not understand English, that
it would be practically impossible to do this.
The argument usually given was that presented
by Joseph G. Votava of Omaha, a Roman
Catholic, representing the Bohemians:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>About having separate meetings for the old folks and the
children&mdash;this question came up from Greeley County, and
they wanted us to have our German service between nine
and ten, and Sunday school between ten and eleven, and
from eleven to twelve an English sermon. The old folks
and the children come together in the same vehicle, and
they certainly don't expect the children to sit down on the
curbing or in the shade until the old folks get through, and
therefore it is hard to separate the meetings in the rural districts,
of which we have many congregations all over the
state.</p></div>

<h3>BILINGUAL SERVICES</h3>

<p>That it is possible to have bilingual services successfully
was testified to by John P. Gross, Hastings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Nebraska, a United States citizen born in
Russia, representing the Adams County Council
of Defense. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Then we were told to have one preaching service a week
in the English language, and we all agreed to do that, and
we were told we could have as much German besides that
one English sermon as we wanted. And we agreed to have
that one English sermon. I went to my congregation of
three hundred and fifty people, at least half of whom did
not get any benefit from the English sermon, and I put it
before them and told them, this is what we are requested
to do; you don't have to do it, but they would like to have
you do it, and they unanimously voted in my church, and
every other church in the county, to adopt the plan. Our
congregations in the evening are not as large as before
because some of the older people do not come now, but
enough come to church who are living in our community so
that we can hold the service. So we have lost in one way,
but we are slowly gaining along another way; one old
grandfather there said it would have been better if these
plans had been adopted fifteen years ago. And this plan
has worked very satisfactorily in our county.</p></div>

<p>In several of the rural immigrant communities
visited by the writer there were successful bilingual
churches. In the Polish colony at Posen,
Michigan, the sermon in the Catholic Church is
in two languages, Polish and English. The
priest explained that the Polish language is
needed, as the people, especially the older people,
understand it better and the priest is able to
penetrate their souls more intimately in their
mother tongue. The English language is needed
for two reasons: among the colonists are a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
American farmers who belong to the same church
and do not speak Polish; and a few of the younger
generation understand English better than Polish,
especially those newcomers who have been born
outside of the colony among Americans.</p>

<p>In the Dutch colony at Holland, Michigan, the
churches are bilingual. One service in the
morning is in the Dutch language and the other
in the evening is in the English language. English
has become a necessity because a number of
the young people have difficulty in understanding
Dutch, and also because a number of the congregation
are either native born or of some other
nationality.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH FAVORED BY MEMBERS</h3>

<p>On the whole, the writer, in his field study, was
impressed by the fact that the rank and file of
the immigrant congregations favored the English-language
service, while the priests and pastors
were opposing it. Whenever an English-language
service had been lately introduced it had been done
under the pressure either of the members of the
congregation or of the state Council of Defense.</p>

<p>The clergy often maintained that the foreign-language
service was needed, even in cases
where the members of the congregation were
largely American born and understood and spoke
English well in everyday life. Perhaps the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
conspicuous in making such claims were the
German Catholic and Lutheran priests and pastors.
According to a number of them, no other
language than German is suited for services, no
matter how far advanced the church members
are in the use of English.</p>

<p>There were cases where among the membership
of a German-language church there were
Bohemians or Scandinavians or Poles. To the
writer's question whether services for these
people were conducted in their mother tongue,
the answer was usually given in the negative,
with the explanation that there was no money
to engage additional preachers and that these
people understood German well. The only explanation
of such extreme claims for foreign-language
services is the nationalism of the clergy.</p>

<h3>OPPOSITION TO "INTERFAITH" MARRIAGES</h3>

<p>Certain church authorities hinder amalgamation
of the immigrants by making severe requirements
in regard to "interfaith" marriages. For
instance, in a case where one party is Catholic
and the other is not, the Catholic Church requires
a written sworn statement from both parties in
regard to certain conditions which they must fulfill
in their married life. What these conditions
are the following blank given to the writer by a
Catholic bishop shows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
There is no question that such requirements
may prevent a number of marriages between
native born and immigrants, when one is a
Catholic and the other a non-Catholic. It is not
always possible for a non-Catholic to follow the
required conditions and as a result family quarrels
and the disruption of families may occur.
The writer has observed three such cases. In
one case there were involved a native and an
immigrant, and in two cases immigrants alone.</p>

<p>A similar ban or check on interfaith, which
often means international, marriages is found
among sectarian immigrant groups. Their extreme
religious sentiment prevents them from
marrying outsiders, and as a result inbreeding
occurs. They marry close relatives and defectives.
For instance, near Lincoln, Nebraska,
where a small German colony of Mennonites is
settled, the birth of idiots and otherwise defective
children was so noticeable that the
colony's leaders and their neighbors decided to
bring about a change. The marriage of close
relatives was prohibited and the ban on marriage
with outsiders was done away with. This
change has had a very good result, according to
the colony's leaders. The change was possible
only because the sectarian beliefs had been
weakened under the pressure of the general
American conditions.</p>

<p>The orthodox Jews are similarly opposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the marriage of their members with the Gentiles.
So far as the writer has learned, they do not require
signed promises. They are uncompromising in
such matters and ostracize any one of their
members who marries an outsider.</p>

<p>The usual explanation of the need of such a
ban or check on interfaith marriages is that if
the parents are of different faiths the children
will be lost to the Church. Whatever the explanation
or justification of the Church opposition
to interfaith marriages, it often applies to immigrants
and makes for their continued separation
from America.</p>

<h3>IMMIGRANT PASTORS</h3>

<p>Very often the priests and pastors of the immigrant
churches are freshly arrived immigrants
themselves. They scarcely speak English and
know little about America. Consequently they
are not able to educate the members of their congregations
in American ways. On the contrary,
they tend to criticize America and favor their
old country in their sermons, public addresses,
and activities. During recent years quite a
number of such church heads have been prosecuted
in the courts for their seditious utterances
and activities.</p>

<p>Testimony given at the hearing before the
state Americanization Committee in Lincoln,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Nebraska, showed how many of the ministers
know little of the English language and little of
America:</p>

<p>Joseph G. Votava of Omaha, representing the
Bohemians, Roman Catholic, stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A great many of the ministers have come from foreign
churches and countries, and if you gentlemen were forced
to listen to them making English sermons, I don't know
whether you would go to church very often or not.</p></div>

<p>Rev. F. E. Pomp, Omaha, representing the
Swedish Evangelical Mission Association of
Nebraska, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A great many of the ministers in our denomination were
born in Sweden; some preach very well in English, but the
majority, perhaps, of those born in Sweden cannot preach
in the English language.</p></div>

<p>The statement of Rev. Matt W. Nemec,
Wahoo, Nebraska, Bohemian Roman Catholic,
was:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There are eight of these gentlemen who have come over
here and are in training, and they cannot speak the English
language fluently, and it would be a great hardship for them
to come up before the young people who speak English very
well and try to preach in English.</p></div>

<h3>POTENTIAL POWERS FOR GOOD</h3>

<p>An immigrant church can do much toward the
amalgamation of its members. There are a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
immigrant churches, Catholic as well as Protestant,
which are doing valuable work in this
direction. But while an immigrant church can
do much good it also can do much harm when its
services and activities are conducted in the
spirit of preference of the old country to America.
To prevent such harm some action must be taken
by the public.</p>

<p>The writer recommends that the immigrant
church heads (priests, pastors, ministers, rabbis,
and others) should be American citizens either
by birth or by naturalization. Foreign-language
services should be conducted for freshly arrived
immigrants only, and for those old-time immigrants
who have not mastered English.</p>

<p>Immigrant churches should be required to
report regularly on the Americanization progress
of their congregations (number of families, home
language, service language, naturalization, etc.)
to the state or Federal Bureau of Education.</p>

<h2>XI<br />
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL</h2>

<p>The preceding three chapters show how important
is the public school as an instrumentality
of Americanization. The question is whether the
rural public school meets present-day requirements.
Field investigations and search through
both public and private reports have convinced
the writer that the rural public school is the most
neglected class of all the educational institutions
in the country. It is far behind the times. It not
only does not adequately meet the problem of
immigrant children, but it does not even root out
illiteracy from the rural population in general.
Some of its limiting features are inevitable, while
others are gradually being changed.</p>

<h3>LIMITATIONS OF THE ONE-TEACHER SCHOOL</h3>

<p>The great majority of rural public schools are one-teacher
schools. The Commissioner of Public
Education of California stated that there were
in the state of California in 1918, 2,300 one-room
public schools and 410 two-room schools. Over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
a third of all the Wisconsin school children, city
as well as country, and 42 per cent of the Wisconsin
school-teachers, are found in the one-teacher
country schools.
<a name="FNanchor_I_1" id="FNanchor_I_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_1" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> A report on school conditions
in Arizona shows that 149 rural schools, or 70
per cent of a total of 214 reporting, are one-teacher
schools.<a name="FNanchor_I_2" id="FNanchor_I_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_2" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The one-teacher school usually means a crowd
of children of various grades taught by one
teacher during the same day. In most cases the
recitation work can go on only with one grade
at a time, while the other grades have to do study
work. Without the supervision of the teacher,
this is much less efficient than the recitation
work. About two thirds of the rural teachers
answering questionnaires sent out by the United
States Bureau of Education
<a name="FNanchor_I_3" id="FNanchor_I_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_3" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> instructed eight or
more grades and held from twenty-two to thirty-five
classes a day, which means that the recitations
averaged the absurdly short time of nine to thirteen
minutes. A few teachers manage to lengthen
the recitations by a system of organizing the
grades into groups and of combining classes, but
this is the exception, not the rule.</p>

<p>As a rule the one-teacher schools have limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
room and equipment. Most of these schools
visited by the writer were small one-room frame
buildings with porchlike attachments on which
were built a tiny hall and dressing "rooms." Quite
a few did not have even these "modern conveniences."
The toilets are usually at a distance
from the building and are not always kept clean.</p>

<p>Several teachers stated that the smallness and
poverty of the schools have a depressing influence
upon the teachers and prevent any great respect
on the part of the people toward the school.</p>

<p>A third defect of the one-teacher school consists
in its monotony and lack of color and
variety as compared with larger schools. Rivalry
is lacking and the recreation enterprises are
limited. Of course, much depends upon the
qualities of the individual teacher, but a good
teacher does not stay long in a one-teacher school;
she is attracted by better opportunities elsewhere.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with the one-teacher school the
writer found to be quite general, even among the
immigrant settlers. The Finnish settlers at Rudyard
in upper Michigan expressed the wish that
the government should give a better public-school
system, although the existing schools were said to
be standard schools. They wanted three or four-room
schools, a better heating system, and higher
salaries for teachers. Only in this way could
better teaching forces be attracted and kept
steadily in the same schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
The Polish colonists in Posen, Michigan, explained
that they have six one-room standard
public schools in the colony and its vicinity, but
that as the teacher has to deal at the same time
with eight grades the efficiency of her work is
naturally below what it should be. The settlers
said that consolidation or enlargement of the
schools is badly needed. No agricultural training
is included in the school work.</p>

<p>Reverend Kuizinga of the Dutch colony at
Holland, Michigan, stated that in the backwoods
parts of the colony, in purely rural districts, the
school activities ought to be more efficient than
they are; certain schools might be consolidated
so as to make fewer grades for one teacher,
teachers' salaries must be increased, and the program
for teaching citizenship broadened.</p>

<p>A leader of an Italian colony at Canastota,
New York, stated that the Italian parents appreciate
the schooling of their children, who attend
the American public schools, speak English
among themselves, and prefer the American to
the Italian ways of life. In regard to the same
colony, the county school superintendent said
that the Italian children attend school fairly
regularly, are able pupils, and excel American
children in their studies.</p>

<p>There is at least one school district in the
same colony which has a defective one-teacher
school, which the writer chanced to visit. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
trustee of the school, an American woman, married
to an unnaturalized Italian settler, said
that she was worried about getting a school-teacher
for next year, as the county pays only
$17 a week. Last year it paid $15, and that was
an increase of $3 over the former salary. She
thought the county might possibly pay $20 this
year if she could not get anyone for less. The
people did not like the teacher they had last
year&mdash;they thought she did not know enough.
There are now seventy-three children of school
age, but there were only twenty-six before, and
the schoolhouse is only large enough for twenty-six.
The building is very small, oblong in shape,
with a small partition at one end for cloakroom
and entrance. The school board voted $250 for
enlarging the building and taking down the partition,
but the trustee was certain that this
would not be done for that small sum, as "lumber
is so high, and the carpenter wants something."
The building needed painting and a number of
the windows were broken The woman said that
last year many children of school age worked instead
of going to school, as there was nobody to
force them to go. Now that she was trustee, she
said, she would see that everybody went.</p>

<h3>GROWTH OF THE CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL</h3>

<p>The defects of the one-teacher school have led to
the consolidation movement which is rapidly developing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
throughout the country. The Superintendent
of Public Instruction of North Dakota
reported in 1916 that the consolidated school was
becoming more and more the school of the rural
districts and he recommended liberal state aid
to these schools. There were at that time 123
"open country" consolidated schools in the state
and 210 town consolidated schools, the latter
being in reality rural schools.</p>

<p>One county superintendent reported that in
the last two years a number of districts had
voted to consolidate their schools; another said
that 40 per cent of the pupils were attending
consolidated schools. The Rural School Commissioner
of Minnesota stated that consolidation
has a very promising growth in the state; that
210 districts have been organized, half of which
were established during the two years ending in
1916. And so the story goes in each state that
has a largely rural population.</p>

<p>There is some opposition to this movement by
parents who live farthest from a proposed consolidated
school, because of the distance and inability
to provide children with hot lunches.
But this opposition is easily overcome by the
provision of public transportation facilities for
the children and by serving hot lunches at the
schoolhouses. Some opposition comes from the
landowners in the neighborhood of a one-teacher
school which has to be closed on account of consolidation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Their fear that there will be a lowering
of land values is baseless, as the settlers in
that section get much better school accommodations
through consolidation than they had
before.</p>

<p>Advantages of the consolidated school over the
one-teacher school are obvious. It makes possible
a better division of time in recitation and
study. The teaching is more efficient on account
of specialization and a better and more stable
teaching staff.</p>

<p>In the office of the State Superintendent of
Public Instruction, North Dakota, the writer
found the following statements in the reports of
various county superintendents for 1916.
<a name="FNanchor_I_4" id="FNanchor_I_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_4" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Barnes County:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The past two years have been marked by the number of
districts that have voted to consolidate their schools. Five
township consolidated schools have been built in the open
country. Each of these buildings has four schoolrooms, a
good-sized gymnasium, an auditorium with a stage, domestic-science
room, and a manual-training room. They are
modern buildings in every respect, steam heated, water system
for drinking fountains and toilets. One six-room village
consolidated school and one open country two-room school
have also been completed. They are also modern buildings.
In these schools the country child has equal opportunities
with the city child. These schoolhouses are used as centers
for the social life of the neighborhood and are proving most
successful.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>Benson County:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Several districts during the past two years have consolidated.
We believe these schools are demonstrating their superiority
over one-room schools at least in the way of graduating pupils
from the eighth grade. Ten schools operating as consolidated
schools graduated as many farm boys and girls as did nearly
eighty one-room schools, during the past year.</p>

<p>In connection with practically every consolidated school
is some form of community or farmer's club.... Especially
during the past year much was done through these agencies
for the promotion of rural life, social and educational. The
consolidated school principal, with his faculty, is experiencing
a new and enlarged obligation and opportunity.</p></div>

<p>Bowman County:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Considerable work for consolidation has been done from
this office. Sixteen public meetings have been held, and the
proposition of consolidation thoroughly discussed with more
than twelve hundred of our people. Through this system
of education the movement is finding favor with our people,
and it will be only a short time before more than half of this
county is consolidated.</p></div>

<p>McHenry County:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have three purely country consolidated schools, each
serving a township, and from our experience here we have
come to the conclusion that districts of this kind are not a
success with bus transportation unless they have an assessed
valuation of $175,000 or more. Part of the burden of transportation
must be borne by parents of the children attending
school. With the family transportation system these
schools are working out very well, being able to employ
three teachers and run nine months of school per year without
exceeding the maximum tax levy.</p>

<p>Eighteen consolidated and graded schools were in operation
in the county last year, and 40.2 per cent of all the
children in the county are now enjoying graded school
facilities.... McHenry is a purely agricultural county.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Everywhere the consolidated school has been
successful and has shown far greater efficiency
than the scattered one-teacher schools. This
gives promise that the consolidated rural school
will in a few years prevail.</p>

<h3>THE RURAL SCHOOL-TEACHER</h3>

<p>In a number of states visited by the writer the
prevailing type of rural school-teacher was a girl
of from eighteen to twenty years of age. That
the country school-teacher is an astonishingly
young person is attested by all reports on the subject.
An educational survey of South Dakota
<a name="FNanchor_I_5" id="FNanchor_I_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_5" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
showed that the largest group of rural teachers
range between nineteen and twenty-five years of
age; twenty-nine teachers were under seventeen
years of age, and fifty-three were just seventeen.</p>

<p>Most of the teachers about whom the writer
collected information were serving their first or
second year. Only a few had been teaching for
three or more years. According to the above survey
of South Dakota, 31 per cent of the rural
teachers were teaching their first school, and
only 9.6 per cent had taught as many as four
schools. Few teachers, the report showed, have
taught more than one or two years in a school,
while the average teaching life of a rural teacher
is three and three quarters school years. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
instability of the profession is so great that it is
necessary for the state of South Dakota to
recruit annually about one third of its total
teaching force of 7,000.</p>

<p>An investigation made by the United States
Bureau of Education in 1915 covering all sections
of the country found that the number of school
years taught by the average rural teacher was
six and one half, but stated that the large majority
of these teachers fell far below the average.
The average time spent by a teacher in one community
is extremely brief; the investigation
showed that it is less than two school years, or
considerably less than one calendar year. Even
this average is considered a high one for the
majority of the teachers.</p>

<p>Equally illuminating figures on this point are
contributed by the state of Wisconsin. The state
Superintendent of Education reports as follows:<br /></p>

A number of the teachers that the writer interviewed
had only grammar-school education, with
a year or two of high school. Only a few had full
high-school training. In general the training
which qualifies the rural teacher for his work is
appallingly slight. Of the rural teachers in
South Dakota covered by the survey mentioned,
58.3 per cent had completed a four-year
high-school course; 45.8 per cent reported attendance
at professional schools; 54.2 per cent
became teachers by taking examinations instead
of by going through normal schools and colleges
of education.</p>

<p>The investigation of the United States Bureau
of Education referred to above brings out the
striking fact that about one third of the rural
teachers have had no professional preparation
whatever, not even summer courses or other
short courses. It was discovered that 4 per cent
of them had less than eight years of elementary
training, and that 45 per cent of the rural teachers
have completed four years of high-school
work, but have not done more.</p>

<p>A bulletin of the United States Bureau of
Education<a name="FNanchor_I_7" id="FNanchor_I_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_I_7" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> presents the following facts regarding
the training of rural school-teachers: The average
rural school-teacher remains in the teaching profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
less than four school years of 140 days
each. This means a complete turn-over of
teachers every four years, or that about 87,500
new teachers must be provided annually. During
the school year ending 1915 the normal schools
graduated 21,944 students. It is quite certain
that most of these found positions in towns and
cities, as did most of those graduating from
schools of education in universities and colleges.
Therefore the great majority of the
87,500 new teachers needed annually for the
rural schools must go to their work professionally
unprepared.</p>

<p>Extracts from the reports of county superintendents
in various states show the same low
level of qualifications; one reports that nearly
40 per cent of his teachers have been untrained
and inexperienced. The following quotations are
taken almost at random from the 1916 reports
of county superintendents filed in the office of
the state Superintendent of Public Education of
North Dakota,<a name="FNanchor_I_8" id="FNanchor_I_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_I_8" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and might be duplicated by reports
from almost any other state having a largely
rural population.</p>

<p>Bowman County:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>During the last two years (1914 and 1915) nearly 40 per
cent of our teachers have been untrained and inexperienced.
We are trying to convince our school boards that training<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
for teaching is just as essential as training for any other
vocation in life, and that the trained teacher is worth more
and should receive more pay than the untrained, and that
the sooner we engage trained teachers for our schools the
sooner we will have better schools.</p></div>

<p>Logan County:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is a lack of permanency in the teaching force (due
to lack of resident teachers&mdash;over 90 per cent are non-residents),
and this has many disadvantages. Too many of
the rural teachers are not in sympathy with the rural conditions
in this county.</p></div>

<p>The teachers in the rural districts, especially
in the backwoods places, impressed the writer
as having little influence upon the surrounding
community, particularly in cases where the
community was composed solely of immigrants.
The immigrants seem not to take the teacher
seriously. A number of them said that they do
not go for any practical advice to the school-teacher,
believing that such a young girl knows
little. In personal interviews the teachers said
that they are doing some Americanization work
by explaining to the children certain big historical
events in the country's life, such as
Washington's crossing of the Delaware, the
battle of Bunker Hill, the liberation of the negroes.
Their understanding of the difference
between the American democracy and the
European autocratic and aristocratic governments
seemed to be vague. Even their knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of American history was mechanical rather
than conscious or interpretative. In general,
the writer was impressed that teachers of this
type&mdash;young girls&mdash;themselves need further development
before they can do effective educational
work in the schools, not to speak of the
community.</p>

<p>The teachers themselves complained of low
salaries, difficulties in handling boys, especially
immigrant boys who come from big cities. There
are hardships in finding suitable living quarters
and board, particularly in new immigrant colonies
where the people live in shanty-like shelters
and continue to eat pork and sauerkraut, sour
milk, herring, onions, etc. One teacher, a girl
about nineteen, told the writer that she could
find an American farm only at a distance of five
miles from the school and that she had a hard
time to reach the school from her boarding place
in the winter snows and blizzards.</p>

<p>Not one of the teachers interviewed expected
to make teaching a lifetime profession. They
all looked upon their present position as only a
stepping-stone to a better life. They hoped
either to continue study and go through college,
or to take up skilled office work, such as that of
a stenographer or bookkeeper.</p>

<p>In regard to the influence of the nationality of
the teacher upon her work in a public school
there have been no authoritative data published.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
In a number of the immigrant colonies investigated
by the writer immigrant teachers were
employed. While both the colonists and their
leaders claimed that a teacher of their own nationality
can get better results in her work than
a native teacher, because of her intimate knowledge
of the colonists and their children, the
school authorities and the native neighbors did
not believe there was any difference. If a
teacher of foreign parents was born in America
or immigrated in childhood, has received American
schooling and normal training, and if she
speaks perfect English, knows and loves the
country, there cannot be any difference.</p>

<p>In one case the head of a native family expressed
his dislike of a teacher of Finnish nationality
on account of her defective English and
because she taught foreign songs and plays to the
American children. As the teacher was on vacation,
the writer could not interview her. The colonists
themselves believed that she was a good teacher,
for the children liked her; and the county superintendent
was satisfied with her teaching progress.</p>

<p>In Vineland, New Jersey, there were four
teachers in the public schools of Italian parentage.
These teachers would be counted as Americans
in every way. As they understand Italian,
know the Italian immigrants and their children,
they get better results in their school and community
work than the native teacher. One good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
thing is that they stay in the same school much
longer than the latter.</p>

<p>In general the writer is inclined to the opinion
that, given equivalent abilities and training, the
teacher with the command of the foreign language
can do better work in an immigrant community
than a native-born teacher who speaks
only English. Such a teacher must be thoroughly
imbued with the American spirit and
traditions. She will have a better chance of imparting
these to her pupils and their parents if
she has also a knowledge of, and sympathy for,
the nationalistic backgrounds and inclinations of
the people in her community. This is a rare
combination to find in a rural school-teacher,
but it typifies the characteristics needed to succeed
in amalgamating the colonists, both young
and old, into a common life and purpose.</p>

<h3>IRREGULAR SCHOOL ATTENDANCE</h3>

<p>It is a fact that school attendance is much poorer
in the agricultural sections than in the industrial
centers. It is believed that on an average about
20 per cent of the rural children of school age do
not attend school at all. The attendance of the
children of immigrant settlers is less than that
of the children of native farmers. The immigrants
are more used to child labor in the old
countries. They are hard pressed financially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
often paying off mortgages and developing new
land. The land and colonization companies are
sometimes known to encourage rather than discourage
the use of child labor by the settlers in
their newly created colonies.</p>

<p>The states vary in the length of school term
provided for children, ranging from about five
months to over nine months. In only three fifths
of the states, however, are children compelled by
law to attend the full school year.<a name="FNanchor_I_14" id="FNanchor_I_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_I_14" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In only rare
cases are the compulsory attendance laws completely
inforced, so that the average amount of
schooling the child gets is less than that prescribed
by law, and in a number of states less
than the amount of schooling available. This is
especially true in rural districts.</p>

<p>The situation in some of the states where land
settlement is being carried on is indicated by the
data given below. Although urban and rural
figures are not distinguishable, those given are for
predominantly rural territory. Wherever city
populations are included it is a safe assumption
that the attendance showing is better than in the
country districts alone. In Arizona, where conditions
are almost entirely rural, the percentage
of children not attending any school is 14 per
cent or above in every county, and runs as high
as 48 in one of the counties.</p>

<p>The irregular attendance of children at the
schools in rural districts of Minnesota is commented
upon as follows:<a name="FNanchor_I_16" id="FNanchor_I_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_16" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Irregular attendance is an evil beyond calculation, and we
have much of it in the open country school. Many schools
last year showed an average daily attendance of less than
60 per cent&mdash;children in school only one half or two thirds
of the time.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>Anoka County:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The loss of time in the consolidated school is only two
thirds of that lost in the other rural schools.</p></div>

<p>Kittson County:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>During the fall of the year farm hands are very scarce,
and many of the older children have to be kept out of school
to assist with the farm work. On account of deep snow and
cold many children have to stay out of school during winter.
Transportation in winter would help improve attendance in
winter.</p></div>

<p>The per cent of attendance for the entire state
of North Dakota was, for the year ending June
30, 1914, 87 per cent, and for the following, 88
per cent.<a name="FNanchor_I_17" id="FNanchor_I_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_I_17" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> County superintendents in the state
sent in the following reports for 1916.</p>

<p>McIntosh County, which is largely populated
by Germans:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An investigation showed that hundreds of children of
school age were either not attending school at all or were
lamentably irregular in their attendance, for no legal or
otherwise good excuse. In order to set an example, several
cases were prosecuted, and this seemed to have a good moral
effect all over the county.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
    <a href="images/i0254b.png" >
    <img src="images/i0254a.png" width="250" height="146" alt="Children farming" title="" /></a>
    <p class="caption">IMMEDIATE RETURNS FROM CHILD LABOR DO NOT MAKE UP FOR LOSS OF SCHOOLING<br /></p>
</div>

<p>Ransom County:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>About half our county is consolidated. I find that we
have 1,750 pupils enrolled in our graded and consolidated
schools, the average daily attendance of which is 75.4 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
cent. There are only 993 pupils enrolled in the one-room
schools, and their per cent of attendance is 59.4 per cent.</p></div>

<p>In South Dakota the actual attendance of
those enrolled in the country schools is less than
60 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_I_18" id="FNanchor_I_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_I_18" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> From Campbell County it was
reported as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Most of our people are German-Russians and do not favor
long terms of school, as they want the labor of their children.
For this reason it is hard, even impossible, to secure
regular attendance. Their schools must not begin earlier
than October, and close by April 1st.</p></div>

<p>The Superintendent of Public Instruction of
Nebraska reports for 1916 as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The average daily attendance, based on enrollment, is a
fraction of 72 per cent. The loss is mostly to the rural
children. Country people find it somewhat easier to provide
employment for their children than do the people of
our towns and cities, consequently the attendance in our
city schools is larger and more regular, and a much larger
percentage enroll.</p></div>

<p>In California the compulsory-school-attendance
law is rigidly enforced, except in the case
of floating families. In this connection the Commissioner
of Public Education made the following
explanation to the writer: The California
industries are mostly seasonal, which means that
the vast majority of labor forces are seasonal and
floating. During the seasons of fruit and hop-picking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
cannery and lumber operations, large
numbers of laborers' families move from place to
place. To keep track of their children and to
compel their school attendance is almost beyond
the power of the present school authorities, especially
as they are now organized.</p>

<p>The state school-attendance laws vary greatly,
and one finds still more variety in the enforcement
of these laws. The greatest difficulties are
experienced in the rural districts. Using child
labor in farming is a deep-rooted tradition. The
children are looked upon by their parents as their
economic asset. Moreover, it is a hard-headed
conviction among the rural population that child
labor is beneficial to the children themselves;
they learn to work, their bodies are strengthened,
they acquire good habits of life, etc. That
the children are deprived of the opportunity to
play&mdash;to develop as their nature requires&mdash;and
to acquire a general education; that this results
in their mental abilities and social instincts being
undeveloped, the young people remaining bashful
and shy; and that even their physical development
is greatly restricted by overwork&mdash;the
rural advocates of child labor cannot understand
nor recognize.</p>

<p>In many cases the county school superintendents
are elected by the people who, in the main,
are the parents of children. When the position
of the superintendent depends upon the will of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the parent farmers, it is often impossible to enforce
the attendance law.</p>

<h3>PRACTICAL CURRICULUM NEEDED</h3>

<p>There is widespread dissatisfaction with the present
program of the public schools among the
rural population. They say that no practical
training is given to their children. They feel
that the teaching is aimed to prepare their children
for high schools and colleges only, where
only a very small percentage ever go. For instance,
the Minnesota Department of Education
reports for 1915&ndash;16 that approximately 70 per
cent of the country children do not go beyond
the elementary grades. Only 5,532 out of 215,427
children in rural schools graduated from the
eighth grade for the year. Those who do enter
high schools, and, later, colleges, are indeed lost
to the rural population, for the college-trained
boys and girls seldom return to the soil. The
children who do not enter high school remain on
the farms, but they have secured almost no practical
training for rural life, either as farmers or
farm laborers. Instead, they have been prepared
for high school.</p>

<p>The school program was especially sharply
criticized by the Russian sectarian peasants at
Glendale, Arizona. "Why, the school is making
out of our children dancers and soldiers of war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
instead of farmers&mdash;soldiers of the soil!" exclaimed
a gray-headed "prophet" in disgust.
Another peasant, perhaps not so high in the sectarian
hierarchy, wanted the school to teach
their boys how to run and repair automobiles
and tractors.</p>

<p>The observations and inquiries of the writer
led him to the conclusion that the criticism of the
school program by various elements of the rural
population is justified to a large extent. The
school program at present generally prevailing
offers little practical training for farmers' boys
and girls. A native farmer in New Jersey explained
to the writer: "There is no use keeping
my children in school after they have acquired
knowledge of reading and writing. They grow
and learn more on my farm than in the school,
for I want them to become land tillers and cattle
raisers." This is perhaps an exaggerated and
overdrawn statement, but, nevertheless, the present
rural public-school program works in favor
of the city at the expense of the rural communities.</p>

<p>Up to recent years the prevailing teaching
language in the public schools has been English,
but in a number of the public schools in the
immigrant rural sections the teaching language
has been German. This is true in the states of
Nebraska and North Dakota. A prominent
church head informed the writer that there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
at least half a dozen schools in McIntosh County,
North Dakota, paid for by the money of the
state, under the direction of the County Superintendent
of Schools, in which the entire teaching
is in German.</p>

<p>The writer found still more numerous cases
where a foreign tongue was a subject of study in
the elementary public school, though English was
the teaching language. Both a foreign tongue as
the teaching language and a foreign tongue as a
subject of study in the elementary public schools
are now done away with under the pressure of
public sentiment against these practices.</p>

<h3>NEED FOR EXPERT ADMINISTRATION</h3>

<p>The limitations to efficient rural-school administration
are many. According to a recent bulletin
of the United States Bureau of Education<a name="FNanchor_I_19" id="FNanchor_I_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_I_19" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> in
more than half of the states the county superintendents
are elected by the people, and in the
remaining states they are either elected or appointed
by county boards, county courts, state
boards, state Commissioner of Education, Governor,
president of township boards, district
boards of education, city or town boards, township
directors, parish boards, local school boards,
or union boards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
In the majority of cases the parents control the
local school inspection and direction. Such democratic
control would be desirable provided the
parents were as enlightened and expert in school
training and education problems in general as
school-teachers and their inspectors and superintendents.
As a matter of fact, the parents,
especially in the rural districts, are quite backward,
and often even ignorant, in these problems.
This is the root of the trouble with the local school
inspection and direction. A county superintendent
is not always elected for his merits as an
educator, but often for his popularity, influence,
and "agreeableness." An elected county superintendent
usually cannot come into conflict with
the parents&mdash;for instance, by insisting on a rigid
enforcement of the school-attendance law entailing
the arrest of the parents for disobeying
the law&mdash;without losing his position at the next
election. This condition causes frequent change
or "rotation" of the county school superintendents,
and is in itself a considerable defect of the
existing system of school inspection and direction.
With a few exceptions, county superintendents
who were interviewed complained of
this "rotation" to the writer.</p>

<p>In most cases no educational or experience
qualifications are required by any higher authority
for inspectors. As a result local politics,
village gossip, and jealousies have free play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Usually there is no provision for office expenses,
assistant, or clerical force. The superintendent's
salary is low, often lower than a
teacher's salary. The superintendent of Ziebach
County, South Dakota, received only $44.76
monthly, while the average teachers salary was
$55.04 per month. Another county superintendent
told the writer that all his salary went for
gasoline and repairs for the automobile with
which he made his inspection tours. To the
question why he served the county without compensation
he answered, "Because I love the
'game' and have my own private income."</p>

<p>Another defect is the fact that the superintendents
have to cover too large a field. A county
contains from one hundred to three hundred
teachers, and nearly as many schools. The
county superintendent is able properly to inspect
all the schools under jurisdiction only once or
twice a year, which is not sufficient for the direction
of the school work. Quite a number of the
county superintendents complained about the
lack of authority over teachers, especially in
their selection and appointment. Under such a
condition, if a teacher carries out the superintendent's
wish or advice, she does so merely from
courtesy.</p>

<p>On the whole, most of the local school inspectors
and superintendents interviewed by the
writer impressed him favorably so far as personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
character went. They seemed to like their work
and were doing what they could under the
circumstances.</p>

<h3>PROPOSED MEASURES</h3>

<p>There is no other public institution in the country
so varied in its organization, its strength, its
methods and ways as the elementary public-school
system. It ranges from a shanty-like to
a palace-like building, from a teacher almost
illiterate herself to a teacher with an education
and training which fit her for a college chair, from
a few hundred dollars of yearly appropriation to
tens of thousands of dollars for upkeep of a
single school, from one teacher to a staff of
teachers in one school, from an almost voluntary
attendance to a rigid compulsory attendance.
All these wide variations, in themselves picturesque,
are a weakness of the system.</p>

<p>When the writer speaks of the weakness of the
elementary public schools he uses this term in a
relative sense, keeping always in mind that there
is no other tool in the hands of the government
so powerful in stamping out and keeping out
illiteracy and hyphenism as the public school.</p>

<p>To make it meet these tasks a uniform public-school
system based on standard requirements
should be established throughout the country
by the Federal, state, and local governments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
closely co-operating with one another for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Education should
certainly be developed and elevated to the
status of a department similar to that in a
number of the states, and in almost all foreign
countries.</p>

<p>The reorganization and the support of an
efficient public-school system would require
heavy public expenditure, a substantial part of
which should be contributed by the Federal
government to the states as an inducement to the
latter to meet the minimum standard requirements
in regard to the public-school system and
to accept Federal inspection of the schools for
the purpose of ascertaining that the states and
the counties were keeping to the minimum requirements,
which might be as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Enlargement of one-teacher schools through
either consolidation or development; no less than
two teachers and no less than three classrooms in
each school.</p>

<p>(2) At least a general high-school education,
two years of training in teaching methods, practical
and theoretical acquaintance with agriculture,
with library work, with first aid and with
recreation and community activities, should be
the minimum requirements for candidates for
teachers in the rural public schools.</p>

<p>(3) The rural teacher must receive a satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
living salary throughout the calendar year,
to be gradually increased as the years of service
increase. A pension for old age, and accident
and health insurance, should be provided. Near
the schoolhouses there must be established
"teacherages," small experimental farms with
family living houses for the teachers.</p>

<p>(4) The school year should be made to coincide
with the calendar year, with a number of
short vacations during the time of special farming
seasons, such as planting in the spring and
harvesting in the fall. The work done by the
children for their parents during the vacations
should be considered as a part of their school
curriculum. They would report on their work
to the school, and receive instructions on how to
do the work in a better way, and at times the
teacher in charge of the children's home work
would make inspection and instruction tours in
the district during the vacation periods.</p>

<p>(5) Each child must be compelled to attend
the public school, or a private school which fully
meets the requirements of the public school, until
he has completed the elementary-school education.
Such school attendance should be rigidly
enforced throughout the country, which would
be possible if the local school authorities, in the
enforcement of the law, were made more independent
of the will of the parents in their districts.
In addition to the inspection by the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
authorities, a Federal system of inspection and
direction should be established.</p>

<p>(6) English should be the teaching language
in all public schools.</p>

<p>(7) There should be included in the school program
instruction in farming methods, varying
according to the local soils, climate, and other
conditions and requirements.</p>

<h2>XII<br />
EDUCATION OF ADULT IMMIGRANT SETTLERS</h2>

<p>The adult immigrant settlers need American
education, the women more than the men. This
fact was clearly impressed upon the writer
during his field investigation. The women do
not penetrate the American world; they live in
the Old World, their children live in the New,
and the men in a mixed world. No matter how
brokenly or how fluently their husbands speak
English, with but few exceptions the wives
either speak it not at all or attempt a few syllables
of the strange language with a hesitation
and shyness which soon cause them to fall silent
and retire in favor of their children or husbands.
Their social visits, their contact with women and
men other than their family, are confined to
members of their own nationality. They live in
a cage, in which they suffer, but to which they
cling because it is all of life that they know.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF REACHING WOMEN</h3>

<p>To reach them, to bring them out into the world
in which their families live, is a difficult task.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
It must be undertaken and accomplished, first,
for the purely humane reason of lightening their
lot and making them individually more happy
in the New World; second, for the sake of preventing
the disruption of families, the corner
stone of the present social order; third, for the
sake of creating and sustaining good citizenship.
Whether immigrant women vote or not, they are
an inevitable influence in the political life of the
country. They must be helped to keep pace as
nearly as possible with their children, who are
increasingly under the influence of the American
environment, especially the public schools. Not
only that, but education of the mothers means
a more effectual development of the children, for
the mother is the greatest educator of the nation.
The first question is how to reach them.</p>

<p>It is easy to say that the native women should
go to them, establish friendly social relations, and
in this way influence them. The writer observed
in the field that such attempts have been made
in earnest, but without much result. The first
difficulty is the lack of a common language.
Next is the difference in the levels of intellectual
development. One might question what common
grounds for social intercourse there would be
between an American farmer's wife with either
grammar-school or high-school education and
some European peasant's wife, illiterate, impossibly
shy, and downtrodden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Still, there is a way out. In almost every immigrant
rural colony one may find a more intelligent
immigrant woman, either a mother of a
family who has been long in this country or an
elder daughter who has received a public-school
education, speaks English satisfactorily, and
who, at the same time, speaks the immigrants'
language and knows the families in the colony
more or less thoroughly. Such women should
be approached first, should be brought into intimate
contact with the native families, and should
be induced to take a course of training and become
organizers or teachers of the adult immigrant
women in the colony. They will be able to
effect an organization which might be called the
"Women's Club" or "Mother's Club." Instead
of creating an entirely new body, such organizations
as exist can and should be utilized; there
may be clubs, some co-operative association or a
benefit society. There may be no organization
and one may have to be initiated. In that case
it is desirable that the more developed immigrant
women be appointed to the directorate of
the new organization.</p>

<h3>THE HOME TEACHER</h3>

<p>It would seem advisable for our high schools,
normal schools, and colleges specifically to train
their immigrant girl students to become home
teachers in the colonies of their respective nationalities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Such home teachers, qualified and
trained for their work, should receive an adequate,
living salary. Their duty would be to
visit the immigrant homes, talk with the mothers,
tell them how to rear their children, how to care
for the health of the family, how to prepare
meals of American food and in American ways,
how to can and preserve, and how to work in the
home garden. They should organize recreation
facilities, reading circles, amateur theatricals,
choruses, etc. The home teacher should organize
the women into afternoon classes for learning
English and should induce them to visit the
evening classes with the men. She also would
be the intermediary for the establishment of
friendly and social relations between the immigrant
families of different nationalities and the
native American families. She should be attached
to the teaching staff of the local public school.</p>

<p>Such home teachers have been employed in
California under the direction of the Home
Teacher Act passed in 1915. The conditions of
employment, the duties and qualifications of the
home teachers are outlined by the Act as follows:<a name="FNanchor_J_1" id="FNanchor_J_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_J_1" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Boards of school trustees or city boards of education of
any school district may employ teachers to be known as
"home teachers," not exceeding one such home teacher for
every five hundred units of average daily attendance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
common schools of said district, as shown by the report of
the county superintendent of schools for the next preceding
school year. It shall be the duty of the home teachers to
work in the homes of the pupils, instructing children and
adults in matters relating to school attendance and preparation
therefor; also in sanitation, in the English language,
in household duties&mdash;such as purchase, preparation, and use
of food, and clothing&mdash;and in the fundamental principles of
the American system of government and the rights and
duties of citizenship. The qualifications of such teachers
shall be a regular kindergarten primary, elementary, or secondary
certificate, to teach in the schools of California, and
special fitness to perform the duties of a home teacher;
provided that the salaries of such teachers shall be paid
from the city or district special school funds.</p></div>

<p>The provisions of the law at present limit its
application to congested neighborhoods.</p>

<p>In regard to afternoon classes for the women,
one of the home teachers, Mrs. Amanda Mathews
Chase, writes as follows:<a name="FNanchor_J_2" id="FNanchor_J_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_J_2" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Organize mothers' classes to meet afternoons at the
schoolhouse. This group work seems to me absolutely necessary
in order to cover the ground efficiently, and also
because of the outlook and inspiration for the mothers....
I would suggest forming classes from the leading nationalities,
each class to meet two afternoons a week. One afternoon
the program can be an English lesson, followed by
cooking, cleaning, or laundry. The other afternoon the program
might comprise English followed by sewing, mending,
weaving, or similar handcraft instruction. Sanitation, including
personal hygiene, and patriotic teaching should be
kept in mind.... Every forenoon will be spent in the homes.
After all, the classes will only be islands in the sea of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
visiting. You must visit to form the classes and visit to
hold them. You must visit to see that the knowledge absorbed
at school is actually put into practice at the home.
You must visit to talk over many matters too delicate and
personal to be taken up on class afternoons.</p></div>

<p>The school system of Los Angeles has, under
this law, employed an educated Jewish woman
from Russia for work in the colony of the Russian
sectarian peasants. The impression of the
writer when he visited the colony was that she
was doing splendid work in helping the peasant
women. The writer's belief is that if she had
been of the Russian nationality she would have
accomplished still better results, as the writer
observed some antisemitic feeling among the
peasants in connection with her. One peasant
woman told the writer that this home teacher
was a good protector for them, but did not
recognize that she was their educator. As the
colony is large, the home teacher really could not
do much educational work other than to supervise
the attendance of the children at school and
to help disentangle family difficulties. It would
be advisable to train and employ home teachers
who are of the same nationality as the people of
the colony in which they work.</p>

<h3>ORGANIZATION OF IMMIGRANT WOMEN</h3>

<p>Immigrant women's organizations have been
already started here and there on the initiative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and by the efforts of the immigrant women
themselves. For instance, Finnish women in
Calumet, Michigan, have organized an "Americanization
Club" for Finnish women, with the
intention of extending the movement into other
Finnish colonies in America. The program of the
meetings consists of learning American songs, of
addresses on America, its history, civics, women's
social work, child welfare. The club activities
hope to combat disloyalty, which the club members
believe to exist among a number of the immigrants
of certain nationalities. The main aim
of the club, as its leaders state, is to assist in the
Americanization of the Finnish women in America&mdash;to
eliminate the hyphen, to make the Finnish-American
women Americans.</p>

<p>The Council of Jewish Women in Newark, New
Jersey, has established an Americanization center
for the Jewish women, mothers and grown-up
Jewish girls; while this center is in the city it
illustrates the principle involved. The activities
of the "center" consist of an afternoon English
class for mothers, in order that they may "overtake
their children on the long road of learning,"
and of an English class in the evening for Jewish
girls who work in the factories. The chairman
of the council states that they have found a way
to make the learning of English really interesting
to the foreign-born woman, that until now the
woman who wanted to keep up with her children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
in English had had to go to the evening school,
where she found a mixture of men and women
of all races and all ages. She soon fell behind
the younger and smarter pupils, and lost her
interest. In these English classes of the "center"
the women are practically all of the same
age, the same race, and have the same interests.</p>

<p>These attempts at Americanization by the immigrant
women themselves, under the stress of
the tragedies caused by the estrangement of their
children through the American schooling, point
the way to the remedy above outlined. Help
the immigrant mothers to keep pace with their
children. This is even more important, the writer
believes, than work with the immigrant fathers.</p>

<h3>THE PUBLIC EVENING SCHOOL</h3>

<p>When the writer visited an immigrant rural colony
and found there a large number of old-time
immigrants still unnaturalized, there were two
explanations given. There was, first, the red
tape in the naturalization proceedings; and second,
ignorance of English and of American geography,
history, and form of government. There
had been no opportunity to learn all these things,
although the colonists had wanted to. Only in
a few cases did their own neglect seem to be a
cause for their not being naturalized.</p>

<p>The following field notes of the writer, taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
at random, illustrate the situation in regard to
the knowledge of English and the naturalization
of the settlers in the immigrant colonies.</p>

<p>Italian colony, Canastota, New York. Writer's
observations:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large number of the men spoke very little English.
The women did not speak English at all. All the children
spoke English.</p></div>

<p>Statement by their leader, a storekeeper:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The settlers have organized an "American-Italian Citizens'
Club." All the Italian voters, 117 in number, belong
to this club. The purpose of the club is to educate Italians
in citizenship and to assist them in becoming naturalized.
There are about 250 unnaturalized Italians of voting age.
Two causes have kept them from naturalization: first, their
ignorance; second, the red tape of the procedure. Seventy-five
per cent of the adults are illiterate; 50 per cent of them
do not understand English; only about 25 per cent of the
adults write and read English.</p></div>

<p>Portuguese colony, Portsmouth, Rhode Island.
Statement by the priest:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Seventy per cent of the adults understand English; 50
per cent speak English; 10 per cent speak and write English;
about 80 per cent are illiterate, not only in English,
but in their own language as well. The lack of education
and culture of the adults is the main obstacle in the way of
their becoming Americans. For promotion of Americanization,
settlers should learn English and American ways of
life&mdash;attend evening schools.</p></div>

<p>Statement of a native storekeeper:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The only trouble with these Portuguese is that they lack
even elementary education. The vast majority do not know
how to read and write even in their own language. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
result, quite a number of families live in dirt in their homes,
and these are a source of danger in the spreading of disease.
I do not believe that school would help these old people,
for they never have been in any school and it would be very
hard to teach them anything. The only hope is in the
second and future generations.</p></div>

<p>Russian sectarian peasant colony, San Francisco,
California. Statement by one of their
leaders:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Five per cent have second papers; from 30 to 40 per cent
have first papers.</p></div>

<p>Russian sectarian peasant colony, Los Angeles,
California. Statements made to the writer by
the peasants themselves at a general meeting of
the colony members:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All but one of the members of the colony are unnaturalized.
About 5 per cent have taken first papers. In explanation
as to why they are not naturalized, they brought several
reasons. First, lack of English; second, they have not felt
so far that they are settled permanently; third, they fear
compulsory military service in case they are citizens;
fourth, their religion is opposed to violence, which the government
often uses in enforcing laws. During the discussion
the writer felt that they believed that their not being citizens
had helped keep their sons from being drafted into military
service. The writer explained that their sons were not
drafted solely because of their religion, as conscientious objectors,
and not at all because they were not citizens. For
their own benefit and the benefit of the country the writer
advised them to become citizens as rapidly as possible.
They did not either approve or reject the proposal, but the
writer felt that there was some suspicion.</p></div>

<p>Statement by the home teacher working among
these peasants:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
There ought to be schools to teach English to the parents
at which their attendance would be compulsory. The
children now think they are above their parents. The
parents would gain by the compulsory school. The children
obey the teachers in school, but will not obey their parents.
The children go home and tell their parents that they don't
have to obey them. They lie to their parents. For instance,
the parents are opposed to dancing, but the children dance
just the same. The parents are so ignorant! They read the
Bible, but they don't know what is in the Bible.</p></div>

<p>Russian sectarian peasant colony, Glendale,
Arizona. Statements made by the peasants at
a general meeting:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Not a single one of them is naturalized. Not one has
taken first papers. To the question why, they explained
that they are firm believers in the Kingdom of God, which
is immeasurably higher than the human kingdom and human
governments. They are interested in the spiritual kingdom
and do not care for politics in any way.</p></div>

<p>Polish colony, Posen, Michigan. Statements
by the local priest and the settlers themselves:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>About thirty men of voting age are not citizens. This is
due purely to neglect and the red tape in acquiring papers.
Both Republican and Democratic organizations exist, but
most vote the Republican ticket, believing that the Republicans
keep the country's business going better.</p></div>

<p>Polish colony, South Deerfield, Massachusetts.
Statements by their leaders:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Almost every adult Pole understands English to a certain
degree and is able to make himself understood. About half
of the adults can write English, including those who can
only write their own names. About 50 per cent of the Poles
are illiterate even in the Polish language.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Large, long-established Italian colony, Vineland,
New Jersey. Statements by their leaders:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large number, possibly two thirds, of the adults do not
speak English. All Italian farmers have first papers and
intend to become Americans, and about two thirds have
second papers.</p></div>

<p>So it goes through all the rural colonies of
immigrant settlers. Everywhere the crying need
is for education and training in English, in citizenship,
in agriculture, in everything. For the
remedy, everyone turns to the evening school for
adults.</p>

<p>A large majority of the rural immigrant colonies
in the country, including small country
towns, are without evening schools, without
libraries, without any educational facilities by
which the adult immigrant settler might learn
the country's language, ways of life, the meaning
of citizenship, or better farming methods.</p>

<p>The public evening schools up to this time have
been a city institution.<a name="FNanchor_J_3" id="FNanchor_J_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_J_3" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Only during recent years
have they made their appearance in the centers
of a few rural immigrant colonies. These have
been temporary establishments undertaken either
privately by native Americans in co-operation
with the local immigrants, or publicly on the
initiative of the local government authorities.
The money required has been raised by collections
or the local government has made temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
appropriations. Usually the idea of a school
for adult immigrants was taken up by some
public-spirited and patriotic local leader, a meeting
was held, money secured, a teacher employed,
and the immigrants invited to attend the schools.
Almost in every case the enterprise seemed to
be successful at its beginning. The school was
well attended and the teaching and studying
enthusiastically started. But after a week or two
the students began to drop out. Then, owing
either to the decrease of students or to the lack
of money, the school was closed.</p>

<p>In a large Portuguese colony at Portsmouth,
Rhode Island, a township evening school was
established in 1917&ndash;18. It was well attended,
but after two months the school was closed on
account of lack of funds, though it was very
much needed.</p>

<p>In regard to an experience in establishing a
Methodist evening school in the Italian colony
at Canastota, New York, the county school
superintendent made the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The greatest problem in the education of Italians here is
how to educate the parents. In 1915 they organized at the
Methodist church an evening school for the Italians. About
forty students appeared, and attended the school for about
three or four weeks. They then gradually ceased to attend
the school. The causes were several: there appeared a
doubt with them whether the teachers and supporters of
the school were not trying to induce them to join the
Methodist church; second, there were no regular teachers,
the lessons were given by volunteers, and this resulted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
irregularity in teaching; third, a certain amount of shyness
was apparent. If such an evening school were to be organized
for them with no religious connections, and if it were a
regular school, the Italians would attend it.</p></div>

<p>In Holland, Michigan, where there is a large,
long-established Dutch colony, there was an
evening school, but the attendance declined,
the people claiming that they had no time to
attend it.</p>

<p>At South Deerfield, Massachusetts, in a Polish
colony, there was established an evening school
a year or so ago.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It was a good thing for us [explained an elderly, bearded
leader of the colony]. Quite a number of our people attended
it, but the great majority did not. They simply did not
want to, for they had lots of work to do at home. Perhaps
their bashfulness was the main obstacle. You see, people
with beards and lots of children do not feel well in school.
Look at me. Wouldn't I feel awful there?</p></div>

<p>In Woodbine, New Jersey, a large Jewish
colony, the local manager of the Baron de Hirsch
fund, in charge of the financial affairs of the
colony, stated that there are evening classes held
in the public schools during the winter. Adults
may attend these classes, but they do not. General
subjects are taught in these classes.</p>

<p>A prominent Italian in the Italian colony at
Vineland, New Jersey, said that evening schools
were needed there. A year ago they had one
with two teachers, but the funds gave out. The
people attended. These night schools would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
teach voting, civics, etc., to the adults. The
superintendent of schools in the town said there
were no classes in English for the adult immigrants,
but suggested that for Americanization
purposes classes should be organized and that
the Italian leaders should be approached and persuaded
to bring in Italian people to the classes.</p>

<p>In the Bohemian and Slovak colonies at
Willington, Connecticut, there were no evening
classes or schools, though several of the settlers
thought it would be a good thing to have such a
school and believed that the people would go if
they had a chance.</p>

<p>In interviews, the rural evening-school students
usually explained that they felt "funny" and
were shy and awkward in the school. They
went to the same school which their children
attended, sat on the same benches, had the same
teacher, and read the same books which their
children did. Finally, they stopped, deciding
that their children could do the learning of English
for both themselves and their parents.
They also explained that their time was too
limited to allow of school attendance. After the
daily farm work they have to do chores.</p>

<p>Around a farm, especially a new, developing
farm, there are countless things to be cared for.
There is no moment when a settler can say:
"Now everything is done and I am free." Besides,
even if he does take time and goes to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
evening school, he feels tired there and is restless
about the work left undone at home. Another
explanation given by the immigrants in regard
to their failure to attend the school was that the
school did not teach anything useful to them in
their farming, and that the progress in learning
English was slow, almost imperceptible. It
seemed to them that never would they be able
to master the language, and they grew disappointed
and discouraged.</p>

<p>The impression made upon the writer was that
the complaint about lack of time and weariness
was not well founded. There are certain seasons,
especially in winter, when the settlers have time
to go to the evening school. Even in the heavy
working season they might attend school, for
their fatigue from farm work is rather physical
than nervous or mental.</p>

<h3>EDUCATION MADE INTERESTING</h3>

<p>The root of the trouble is in inadequate programs,
in defective teaching methods and unsuitable
teachers. The knowledge of English, American
ways and standards of living might well be developed
in the immigrant settlers during the
process of teaching them something useful,
necessary, and interesting. A simple course on
farming methods, local conditions, and useful
information could be given, with the probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
result of awakening their enthusiasm and taste
for more.</p>

<p>Such a program makes it essential that the
evening-school teacher know farming and rural
conditions in general and be familiar with the
home life of the students and their racial peculiarities,
to which he has to adjust his methods.
Possibly the best teacher would be a settler's
son or daughter who, after high school, has had
training in agriculture and teaching methods.
The students should be graded according to their
race, level of mental development, and learning
ability, whenever this is possible.</p>

<p>The ordinary method now in use consists in
imitating and repeating the words and sentences,
often disconnected one from another, and the
stories told by the teacher. The formal copying
of the words and sentences written on the blackboard
by the teacher, and reading children's
books are sufficient to discourage the most ambitious
student. Conversation is more successful
than the story-telling method, and exercises in
the reading of popular textbooks on farming and
of popular essays on American history, geography,
etc., are far more interesting to the adult
settlers than children's stories.</p>

    <p class="caption">THE SAME MAN IS WORKING FOR LAND AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT<br /></p>
</div>

<p>The evening school in the rural immigrant
colonies should be provided and attendance for
the adult non-English-speaking immigrants
urged, until they have mastered simple English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the elements of citizenship, and a rudimentary
knowledge of farming.</p>

<p>In almost every colony visited the writer
discussed with the settlers the advisability of
compulsory attendance at evening or afternoon
classes. No one was against compulsion, though
a number suggested qualifications. For instance,
the evening school should operate in the wintertime;
the teaching should include subjects useful
in farming; in the case of hired men, the school
time must be paid for by the employer; the
evening school should be a public institution,
not a private, charitable, or religious enterprise;
if private organizations wish to establish evening
schools, they should do so only under public
regulation and control; the purpose of the
evening school should be to teach English, civics,
and other useful subjects, not to serve any special
or private interests, party, or class; the evening
school should be free of charge to immigrants.</p>

<p>A few settlers wanted the evening school to
teach the operation and repair of automobiles
and tractors; some wanted singing, music, and
theatricals taught; some wanted to be instructed
in the growing and harvesting of special crops,
as, for instance, onions, tobacco, and cotton.
In general, the immigrants expect from the
evening school more than English and citizenship.
They want practical knowledge which
helps them in their farming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>
<h2>XIII<br />
LIBRARY AND COMMUNITY WORK</h2>

<p>So far as Americanization is a question of education
and so far as the printed word is an instrument
of education, the reading of American
literature by the immigrant is of inestimable
value. It might be safely stated that almost
every time an immigrant reads something in
English, be it only a trade label on a tomato can
or an advertisement in a street car, he learns
something about the country, at least a word or
two of the country's language.</p>

<h3>PLACE OF THE PRINTED WORD</h3>

<p>As a rule a newly arrived immigrant is eager to
learn English. It gives him a new sensation and
a feeling of pride to know and speak another
tongue. When he has succeeded in mastering a
few of the most common words and expressions,
like "no," "yes," "how do you do," "good-by,"
"street," "lunch," and others, he likes to use
these words in his conversation with fellow immigrants.
When he says to his friend in his native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
tongue, "Let us go to lunch," the last word is
in English. His eagerness to learn English is increased
by the practical needs of everyday life&mdash;to
get a job, to understand the foreman's directions,
to buy or sell something, to travel, to apply
for licenses, or to make agreements. Everywhere
the immigrant confronts English.</p>

<p>In addition to the signs on streets and shops,
a newly arrived immigrant soon becomes acquainted
with the great American daily, especially
its "help-wanted ads." Here he looks for
a job, reading the "ads." with the aid either of a
dictionary or of some one of his fellow immigrants
who has already mastered the "ad." language with
its queer abbreviations. When he has established
himself in a job, perhaps he begins to think
of taking up a systematic study of English. He
enters an evening school if there is one in his
town. There he makes his first acquaintance
with the American book&mdash;too often a children's
reader containing stories such as "Puss and Her
Kittens," "Patty and the Squirrel," "The Dormouse,"
"Lullaby," "Andy and the Worm,"
which, though perhaps very interesting to children,
do not correspond to the requirements of his
mental development. Nevertheless, the stories
are related in good English and he goes ahead.</p>

<p>As time passes and his mastery of English
grows, he begins to read items in the daily papers
and stories in the Sunday editions. Later he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
takes up the reading of books, perhaps first those
related to his trade, or the subjects which are
connected with his future plans in America.
Still later he begins to read books about America
in general, its history, geography, nature, social
life, etc. An immigrant seldom takes to American
fiction. He ardently tries to be practical,
being mainly interested in that which is useful
and helpful. When he reads general literature
about America he does this for the purpose of
learning to know his new country, knowledge
which would help him to make a success here.
The writer has often been approached by immigrants
with requests that he recommend literature
on, for instance, making a certain kind of
candy, or pickles, or on hog raising or concrete
building. Frequently he has had to translate or
assist in the interpretation of various formulas
and receipts.</p>

<h3>RURAL NEEDS FOR BOOKS</h3>

<p>A demand of this kind for literature by the immigrants
indicates three problems in connection
with their education through the printed word:
first, the immigrant should be advised in his
selection of publications, told which might be the
most useful to him. He is quite unable to make
this selection for himself; second, the means for
acquiring the desired publications should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
supplied. As a rule the immigrant has little
money to spare for books; third, there should
be encouragement and cultivation of the reading
habit among the immigrants as an efficient means
of their general education and, through this, of
their Americanization.</p>

<p>All these problems can be met through the
institution of the public library&mdash;a great agency
for socializing knowledge in a modern democracy.
Though America is one of the countries most
advanced in the development of public libraries,
still the development has not kept pace with the
requirements. This is especially true in regard
to the rural communities. Particularly in rural
immigrant communities, the public library is still
lacking. Out of about forty rural immigrant colonies
visited by the writer during the past year,
about thirty had no library facilities at their disposal,
while the remaining ten were able to pride
themselves on some sort of a library, either school
or parish.</p>

<p>Both these kinds of libraries appear to be very
unsatisfactory. As a rule the school libraries are
small and contain mainly children's books, so
that the adults have not much interest in using
them. The parish libraries contain mainly ecclesiastical
literature and books on the old country's
history and general affairs. The majority of
these last-named books are in a foreign tongue.</p>

<p>An old Polish settler stated that the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
sometimes bring books home from the school,
but that there is nothing in them for the older
people, while the church library is not much,
either, for who cares to read of one Sigismund or
of one Friedrich der Grosse? The settler concluded
by saying that he and his fellow immigrants
would like to read American books about
America. His colony needed an American public
library.</p>

<p>The dean of the extension division of the University
of Wisconsin reports that there are 72
per cent of rural communities which are without
public libraries. This is in a state where the
library facilities are comparatively highly developed.
It has been the writers impression,
while visiting the Wisconsin backwoods immigrant
communities, that though the various
traveling and package libraries and library
"stations" are successfully operating in other
parts of the state, they have not yet reached
these wilderness communities to any extent. As
a rule the rural immigrants do not even know of
the existence of such libraries.</p>

<h3>PACKAGE LIBRARIES IN WISCONSIN</h3>

<p>Yet the demand for literature among the rural
population is great and growing rapidly. Take,
for instance, the package library of the extension
division of the above-mentioned university. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
has more than 10,000 packages. Each package
contains collected literature&mdash;books, newspaper,
and magazine clippings, statistical tables, etc.&mdash;dealing
with a certain subject. It is sent, under
certain conditions, to anyone who requests it.
The demand for such packages has more than
doubled each year. During 1908 and 1909 there
were sent out 524 packages on 116 subjects to
136 localities, and during 1915 and 1916 there
were sent out 5,948 packages on 2,404 subjects
to 483 localities. The reason why such wonderful
carriers of knowledge do not reach the rural
immigrants is obvious; the immigrants do not
know of their existence. Even if they do know,
they do not understand how to order them. In
many other states conditions are much worse.</p>

<p>What must be done to make the library common
to every rural settlement? What kind of
a library is best suited to the needs, and how
shall it be extended to the backwoods rural
communities?</p>

<p>The recommendation of the writer is that the
school libraries be developed and put on a higher
level, with special adult and children's sections.
A library board should be created in each
county as a unit operating under a state law for
the purpose of directing and developing a county
library system. A library tax should be levied
upon each county. Schools, community halls,
and stores should be made library stations, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
that the settlers could have easy access to the
books.</p>

<h3>SELECTION OF BOOKS</h3>

<p>Then there is the question of the selection of
publications for the libraries intended for immigrant
communities. In this, the conditions and
requirements of the immigrant settlers have to
be taken into consideration, for it would be
useless and wasteful to select books in which the
settlers are not interested and which they do not
want to read.</p>

<p>First place must be taken by publications concerning
farming. Particularly should there be
included in such libraries the publications of
Federal and state Departments of Agriculture.
Then comes the literature for the learning of the
English language: dictionaries, grammars, textbooks
on composition, etc. Recreation literature&mdash;books
on sports in the open, plays, music,
etc.&mdash;would be also in demand. Then come the
publications related to American history, geography,
nature, economics, government, and social
life, and other serious publications containing information
about the country's past and present.</p>

<p>Finally comes fiction. A few immigrants who
have acquired the habit of reading fiction prefer
to read stories and poems of a more realistic
character, like those of Jack London, Upton
Sinclair, Ernest Poole, Mark Twain, Arnold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Bennett, Longfellow. The traveling libraries
need not be voluminous so much as of good
quality. Aside from being practically useful,
they should try to help the rural immigrant
settlers to improve their standards of living and
to broaden their intellectual horizon.</p>

<p>But who is going to stimulate and lead such
an extension of the libraries into the backwoods
communities? The national and state-wide library
associations would be the ones to undertake
this work. As they succeeded in the extension
of the American library to the battlefields of
Europe, so they without doubt will succeed in the
extension of the library to the firing line in our
own country&mdash;to the line where future America
is in the making.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that rural communities
will respond to national assistance and greatly
benefit by it. Even if only a small beginning
could be made very soon, increased demand and
local initiative would undoubtedly justify the
project.</p>

<p>The day is not distant when the need of community
books in every American community
will be recognized as an indispensable supplement
to all schooling work. In the new colonies
that are being planned by colonization companies
the library as a part of the general community
scheme must not be overlooked. As the advantages
of having book supplies available become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
manifest, it may be possible to provide local
housing facilities as well as trained assistants.</p>

<p>There may be a room or even a separate building
that can be given over to this purpose. If
there is a general community building, no better
use could be devised for a portion of it than a
small, practical, accessible library. If not the
primary object of such a community building it
would certainly be an important one.</p>

<h3>A COMMUNITY HALL</h3>

<p>A public recreation hall in a rural community
may be made one of the most effective Americanizing
agencies. Public meetings, lectures,
amateur theatrical performances, dancing, public
celebrations, games, sports, etc., may be
held there. It is the neutral place where all
community members, natives and immigrants
of various races, religions, and tongues, meet one
another and learn to know one another, where
the much-needed social visiting among the
natives and immigrants may have its inception.</p>

    <p class="caption">A RURAL COMMUNITY CENTER PLAN WAS DEVELOPED BY THE WISCONSIN COLONIZATION COMPANY<br />

</div>

<p>One of the characteristics of the European
immigrants is their inclination toward singing,
music, and amateur theatricals. In the old
country there is rarely a village which does not
pride itself on some sort of an amusement organization,
be it a choir, a band, or a drama
group. These are to European people what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
sport, baseball, football, and the like are to the
mass of Americans. When the European immigrants
come over they are strange and unsettled,
they have little opportunity for amusement,
they even neglect church attendance. But when
they are settled and have begun to make ends
meet, they usually take up their former amusement
activities, perhaps singing first, then soon
a band, and then the stage.</p>

<p>Under present conditions the natives seldom
mix with the immigrants in their amateur amusement
enterprises. The immigrants conduct these
in their own tongue and select mostly their own
songs, airs, and plays. It is equally true that the
grown-up immigrants seldom acquire interest in
the American sports like baseball and football.
Their children, through the influence of the school
and their intercourse with the American children,
quickly become interested in the American
sports, so much so that the parents fail to understand
and appreciate their enthusiasm. "It's all
right to a certain degree, but my boys seem to
be already crazy for baseball, neglecting everything
else. I am afraid for their future!" complained
an elderly Italian settler to the writer.</p>

<p>Country life is poor in amusements and social
intercourse as compared with city life. Still,
through organized efforts, the rural social life
can be made much richer and even very attractive.
It was common testimony given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the writer by the local community leaders that
they have succeeded in keeping their boys and
girls at home, on the farms, by building a community
hall, organizing singing, games, and
theatricals.</p>

<p>The community dances exert a great attraction
in bringing the native and the immigrant boys
and girls together for common pleasure. It is
quite a sight to watch these dances: the village
band is playing, the boys and girls are dancing,
while the elderly people are sitting around the
walls of the hall and watching the fun of youth,
forgetting their daily sorrows and worries and
remembering perhaps their own youthful days
somewhere beyond the ocean. All, dressed in
their Sunday finery, are in a festive mood.</p>

<h3>AMATEUR THEATRICALS</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most beneficial enterprise in the
community work is the amateur theater. It
gives the richest opportunity for self-expression.
It includes acting, literature, singing, music, and
painting. It amuses and teaches&mdash;it reflects and
analyzes the social life and directs it in its
entirety toward higher levels of achievements.
Whatever the shortcomings and the sins of the
Russian Bolsheviks, in one thing they have
struck, the writer is sure, the right road. This
is in placing the stage at the forefront in popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
education, if only in an experimental and theoretical
way as yet. A properly directed amateur
theater is second only to the school. In a rural
community it brings together varied elements,
brings out the best in each, and unites them by
developing common aims and ideals.</p>

<p>The amateur country theater has made much
headway in the state of North Dakota. The
State Agricultural College at Fargo took the lead
in the movement. The president of the college
attributes the success of the country theater
there not only to the influence of the college
leadership, but also to the deep need for entertainment
and the hunger for social life among the
prairie people who are living on farms at long
distances from one another. The fact that the
population is largely foreign-born stock and has
inherited an inclination toward stage plays is
another reason.</p>

<p>Professor Arvold of the same college, who is
in charge of the development of the country
theater, stated to the writer that their little
country theater has a strong Americanizing influence
upon the population. It brings together
both native born and immigrants of various
nationalities. They learn to know one another.
They learn about America, its history, present
conditions, and future aspirations more than in
any other way. The theater teaches them the
country's tongue, for the plays are given in English.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
He believed that every large rural community
and groups of smaller communities in the
same neighborhood should have an amateur
theater.</p>

<p>The theater, public lectures, exhibitions, and
the American outdoor sports should be centered
in and around the community hall. Such highly
varied activities in community life require a
trained director. He should be a person with a
good general education, with experience in rural
life and affairs and in organizing group activities.
He must be a good mixer and a lover of the work.
For his work he should receive an attractive
salary. Colonization companies have initiated
such work, which should be taken over and
maintained by the community itself.</p>

<h3>COMMUNITY TEAMWORK</h3>

<p>To put the community work in the rural districts
on an organized and permanent basis the writer
recommends that a community board be created
in each county as a unit operating under a state
law for the purpose of directing and developing
rural community work, similar to that which the
writer recommends for the development of rural
libraries. A community tax should be levied
upon each county, the money received to be used
for community work among the population in
the county.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
In community union there is strength. Working
and planning together for any undertaking,
however limited and comparatively humble its
dimensions, inevitably ties its promoters in bonds
of greater understanding and sympathy. Native
and foreign born united for enriching and enhancing
their common life act as a powerful force
for Americanization. Better than any artificially
devised scheme is the spontaneous pulling together
for a common need of all elements of the
community. This constitutes real amalgamation
in a democracy.</p>

<span class="label">[4]</span></a> The figures for 1910 are taken from the Census of 1910, vol. iv, p.
303. The Census of 1900 does not give occupations by nativity. The
figures for 1900 are taken from the <i>Reports of the Immigration
Commission</i>, vol. xxviii, pp. 66, 71&ndash;79, prepared from original and
unpublished data of the Census Bureau. Since the figures for immigrant
female agricultural laborers are incomplete, it has been here assumed
that they were in the same proportion to that of the males in
1910&mdash;namely, about 9 per cent. Therefore the figure 22,850 for the
immigrant female agricultural laborers for 1900 represents an
estimate of 9 per cent of the number of immigrant male agricultural
laborers for 1900.</p>
